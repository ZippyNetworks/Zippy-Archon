Cole Medin started a github projet that outlines a framework for building AI agents with Pydantic AI and LangGraph. The repository is located at https://github.com/coleam00/Archon/tree/main and we are going to focus on version 2 of his example agentic-workflow model. We want to extend the functionality of this setup with tools like n8n or autogpt for a gui frontend to this framework of sorts or come up with any other ideas that might make it easier for the end user to build custom workflows. The idea is to simply give the system a prompt to build a tool for a business and let the Ai Agent orchestrator begin spinning up new agents and deciding on which tools to use and how to customize this workflow so that it can deliver a fully tested and fully functional designed pattern, app, workflow or otherwise as indicated and appropriate for the end user making the request. We want to make use of as many tools and features as possible so we need to make it easy to import new tools and features as well as have a dedicated agent we design that can use reasoning to try to build a new tool for our use now and in the future any time it comes across a new idea that woudl be good to build a connector for to make use of inside our workflows. One such idea I had was to build a tool to connect Archon AI Agent building (as our extended version of it whatever we end up with) to openai Operator or better to allow the user to select which tools to use in the advent user wants to save money and instead use 
open operator or "browser use" which are both open source solutions that work well too. https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand stagehand from browserbase, wrote in typescript, MIT License.

https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use pretty popular, it's in Python, use DOM tree. -- begin by looking over the codebase for Archon and all the imported functions and how he orchestrates the tooling and message passing. Learn all you can from its architecture -then come up with a list of things that we can do to improve this. Remember - I want to build a master tool that can run consistantly and accept calls to it to build a toold for this or a workflow for that and be able to handle errors with intelligence and reasoning before breaking the entire master loop orchestrator. I want the system to be able to continually learn and be able to reference what it has learned through the use of any database system we can host locally or remotely. We have a large stack of computes running in a proxmox cluster and we can spin up any number of LXC or VMs needed to offload work and tasks or host database or rag files. Review the projects and let me know what you think we can improve right now and build a list of future improvements to achieve the game chaning goals I have suggested as well as any advanced features you can think of.

Reasoned for 4 seconds

Below is an overview of how you might think about extending the version 2 “agentic-workflow” (from Cole Medin’s Archon repo) into a more robust system—one that can orchestrate multiple tools, provide a GUI (e.g., via n8n or similar frameworks), and intelligently handle errors while “learning” over time. Since the actual code for Archon is not included here, this discussion is based on the high-level architecture suggested by the repo’s description and the goals you described.

1. High-Level Architectural Concepts
a. Modular, Plugin-Style Tooling

A key improvement is to make the framework welcoming to new tools and services. This suggests designing a plugin (or “extension”) system:

Interface Definition – Define a standard interface or base class that all tools must implement (e.g., a Pydantic model that includes a name, description, input schema, output schema, etc.).

Tool Registration – Provide a mechanism (e.g., an entry in a configuration file, or an automatic discovery routine) so that new tools can be recognized and loaded without modifying core framework code.

Dependency Management – Use packaging and environment isolation (e.g., Python virtualenv or containers) so that each tool can declare its dependencies clearly without creating conflicts.

b. Agent-Orchestrator Pattern

You mentioned having a “master tool” that orchestrates worker agents:

Agentic Workflow Controller – A high-level “conductor” agent that decides which sub-agents are spun up, which tools they call, and how they collaborate. This pattern could be implemented with a hierarchy or distributed approach:

Hierarchy: A single “Master Agent” that delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents.

Multi-Agent Collaboration: Agents can pass tasks around via a shared messaging bus or queue.

Task Decomposition & Coordination – Logic for taking a high-level instruction (e.g., “Build me a Slack integration that notifies the team when a new lead arrives”) and breaking it down into smaller tasks. Each sub-task is either handled by a specialized sub-agent or an external tool.

c. Error Handling & Persistence

Rather than allowing an unhandled exception to break the entire system, the orchestrator can:

Retries & Recovery – If a sub-agent fails (e.g., error from an API call), the orchestrator could:

Retry with a different approach/tool

Ask for more detail or re-prompt the user

Reasoning & Self-Healing – If a chain of calls consistently fails, the orchestrator might consult a “Reasoning Agent” to diagnose the failure (e.g., is there a missing dependency, invalid credentials, or a malformed request?).

Persistent Memory – Use a local or remote database to store conversation context, logs, or “lessons learned” so that repeated problems are recognized and addressed in future runs.

d. Adding a GUI Frontend (n8n, custom web app, or other)

n8n is a low-code workflow automation tool that can provide a GUI for hooking together your various services. You can build a custom n8n node that calls your Archon “master orchestrator” endpoint. This would let a user visually wire up “When this happens → run Archon → do that next.”

For an even tighter integration, you can embed the orchestrator logic inside n8n as a plugin node that spins up sub-agents. The user in n8n sees it as a “New Task from AI” node, configures the prompt, and the rest is handled by your backend.

2. Immediate Areas to Improve in the Archon Workflow
1. Clearly Separate the Core Engine vs. Tools

Refactor the Archon code so there is a core engine that deals with:

message passing

agent states

orchestration logic
Meanwhile, each tool or connector (e.g., Slack, DB integration, CRM, etc.) lives in a separate module or plugin folder.

2. More Robust Message Passing

Look at how messages (prompts, responses, internal states) flow through your system:

Introduce a concept of an envelope (or “structured message”) that includes metadata (e.g., conversation context, tool usage logs, error states).

This leads to more consistent logs for debugging and the option to feed these logs into an LLM to handle error resolution or additional reasoning.

3. Agent Profile / Role Definitions

Use Pydantic (or any typed approach) to formalize the concept of an agent’s “role,” e.g.:

class AgentProfile(BaseModel):
    name: str
    role_description: str
    tools_available: List[ToolRef]
    memory_storage: MemoryRef
    ...


These roles can be dynamically loaded. This approach makes your system more flexible and easy to extend.

4. Integration with Vector Databases

For advanced “in-context” learning or retrieval:

Add a “Knowledge Agent” that uses vector search (e.g., via FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone, or Qdrant) to store new or updated data.

When new data is encountered (like a doc or user conversation snippet), the orchestrator can push embeddings into the vector DB so future calls can retrieve relevant info.

5. Observability & Logs

Add structured logs (JSON logs or a time-series DB) so you can do analytics on:

Number of tasks completed successfully

Which tools are used the most

Where errors occur
Tools like Grafana or Prometheus can ingest logs for visual dashboards.

3. Building Toward Your “Game-Changing” Goals

Below is a roadmap of future improvements aligned with your bigger vision of a master orchestrator that can autonomously build workflows, keep learning, and adapt:

1. Autonomous Tool Connector Generation

Automated Tool Developer Agent: This specialized agent, given a specification for an external service (API docs, user instructions, etc.), can scaffold a new plugin module automatically. For instance:

You say: “I want an integration with XYZ’s REST API.”

The agent fetches or is given the API docs (or scrapes them).

The agent auto-generates a new plugin folder with typed Pydantic classes for request/response, plus any boilerplate code.

The orchestrator can load that new plugin, test it against real or mocked endpoints, then confirm success or highlight errors.

2. Continuous Learning & Self-Correction

Add a background “Critic Agent” that monitors logs and tries to find patterns of failure. When it detects repeated errors or large sets of warnings, it can:

Propose improvements to the code of existing tools or agent logic.

Flag user instructions that consistently lead to confusion or incomplete data.

3. Support for Multi-Tenancy

Let multiple teams or business units use the same Archon instance. Each one has its own set of tools, memory or knowledge bases, and “allowed scope.” This might involve containerization or separate orchestrators per tenant.

4. Integrations with Additional Platforms

n8n or Node-RED: Provide official nodes for your orchestrator in these popular flow-based automation tools. Then the user can visually connect events → your AI orchestrator → subsequent services.

AutoGPT / AgentGPT: Borrow some of their patterns for chain-of-thought or step-by-step sub-goals, but keep it more structured using Pydantic.

5. Advanced Deployment Patterns

Container Orchestration: Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to spin up ephemeral sub-agents or specialized workers that handle large tasks (e.g., data ingestion, complex model inference).

Proxmox: Since you have a Proxmox cluster, you can spin up VMs or LXCs with specific CPU/GPU resources, tie them into the orchestrator via an API or event queue, and scale horizontally for heavy workloads.

6. Enhanced Reasoning & Domain-Specific Add-Ons

If you have recurring tasks in specific industries (e.g., marketing automation, finance dashboards), build domain-specific “expert agents” or knowledge bases. They come with curated tools relevant to that domain (CRM connectors, lead-scoring scripts, etc.) so the orchestrator can match tasks to the best sub-agent.

4. Summary of the Approach

Refactor Archon into a robust plugin-oriented framework (clean separation of the “core agentic engine” from individual tools).

Implement structured message-passing, typed agent profiles, error-handling, logging, and vector-based knowledge retrieval.

Add a “master orchestrator” pattern that can spin up sub-agents for specialized tasks, integrated with n8n or a custom GUI so that non-developers can create or visualize these workflows.

Evolve toward a self-expanding system, using an “Automated Tool Developer Agent” that can build new connectors given an API spec, test them, and integrate them automatically.

Leverage your Proxmox cluster for container/VM-based scaling, tying together the entire pipeline with robust logging, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

By iterating on these ideas, you’ll have a comprehensive framework that can:

Accept high-level prompts from end-users,

Spin up specialized agents (with well-defined roles and tools),

Integrate with a wide range of external services (Slack, CRM, proprietary APIs, etc.),

Handle errors gracefully, learn from mistakes, and keep logs for future reference,

Provide a GUI or low-code interface (using n8n or similar) so users can visually manage their automations.

Ultimately, the goal is a platform that allows you (or your end-users) to say: “Build me a system that does X,” and the orchestrator automatically scaffolds the relevant code, tests it, and continues to refine it based on feedback or errors, all while providing a user-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring.

here is the content of the current version of Archon V2-agentic-workflow README.md "# Archon V2 - Agentic Workflow for Building Pydantic AI Agents 

This is the second iteration of the Archon project, building upon V1 by introducing LangGraph for a full agentic workflow. The system starts with a reasoning LLM (like O3-mini or R1) that analyzes user requirements and documentation to create a detailed scope, which then guides specialized coding and routing agents in generating high-quality Pydantic AI agents.

An intelligent documentation crawler and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built using Pydantic AI, LangGraph, and Supabase that is capable of building other Pydantic AI agents. The system crawls the Pydantic AI documentation, stores content in a vector database, and provides Pydantic AI agent code by retrieving and analyzing relevant documentation chunks.

This version also supports local LLMs with Ollama for the main agent and reasoning LLM.

Note that we are still relying on OpenAI for embeddings no matter what, but future versions of Archon will change that.

## Features

- Multi-agent workflow using LangGraph
- Specialized agents for reasoning, routing, and coding
- Pydantic AI documentation crawling and chunking
- Vector database storage with Supabase
- Semantic search using OpenAI embeddings
- RAG-based question answering
- Support for code block preservation
- Streamlit UI for interactive querying

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Supabase account and database
- OpenAI/OpenRouter API key or Ollama for local LLMs
- Streamlit (for web interface)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/archon.git
cd archon/iterations/v2-agentic-workflow


2. Install dependencies (recommended to use a Python virtual environment):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up environment variables:
   - Rename .env.example to .env
   - Edit .env with your API keys and preferences:
   
env
   BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1 for OpenAI, https://api.openrouter.ai/v1 for OpenRouter, or your Ollama URL
   LLM_API_KEY=your_openai_or_openrouter_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
   PRIMARY_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # or your preferred OpenAI model for main agent
   REASONER_MODEL=o3-mini     # or your preferred OpenAI model for reasoning


## Usage

### Database Setup

Execute the SQL commands in site_pages.sql to:
1. Create the necessary tables
2. Enable vector similarity search
3. Set up Row Level Security policies

In Supabase, do this by going to the "SQL Editor" tab and pasting in the SQL into the editor there. Then click "Run".

### Crawl Documentation

To crawl and store documentation in the vector database:


bash
python crawl_pydantic_ai_docs.py


This will:
1. Fetch URLs from the documentation sitemap
2. Crawl each page and split into chunks
3. Generate embeddings and store in Supabase

### Chunking Configuration

You can configure chunking parameters in crawl_pydantic_ai_docs.py:

python
chunk_size = 5000  # Characters per chunk


The chunker intelligently preserves:
- Code blocks
- Paragraph boundaries
- Sentence boundaries

### Streamlit Web Interface

For an interactive web interface to query the documentation and create agents:


bash
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py


The interface will be available at http://localhost:8501

## Configuration

### Database Schema

The Supabase database uses the following schema:

sql
CREATE TABLE site_pages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    url TEXT,
    chunk_number INTEGER,
    title TEXT,
    summary TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    metadata JSONB,
    embedding VECTOR(1536)
);


## Project Structure

- archon_graph.py: LangGraph workflow definition and agent coordination
- pydantic_ai_coder.py: Main coding agent with RAG capabilities
- crawl_pydantic_ai_docs.py: Documentation crawler and processor
- streamlit_ui.py: Web interface with streaming support
- site_pages.sql: Database setup commands

~~ CONTEXT: ~~

You are an expert at Pydantic AI - a Python AI agent framework that you have access to all the documentation to,
including examples, an API reference, and other resources to help you build Pydantic AI agents.

~~ GOAL: ~~

Your only job is to help the user create an AI agent with Pydantic AI.
The user will describe the AI agent they want to build, or if they don't, guide them towards doing so.
You will take their requirements, and then search through the Pydantic AI documentation with the tools provided
to find all the necessary information to create the AI agent with correct code.

It's important for you to search through multiple Pydantic AI documentation pages to get all the information you need.
Almost never stick to just one page - use RAG and the other documentation tools multiple times when you are creating
an AI agent from scratch for the user.

~~ STRUCTURE: ~~

When you build an AI agent from scratch, split the agent into this files and give the code for each:
- agent.py: The main agent file, which is where the Pydantic AI agent is defined.
- agent_tools.py: A tools file for the agent, which is where all the tool functions are defined. Use this for more complex agents.
- agent_prompts.py: A prompts file for the agent, which includes all system prompts and other prompts used by the agent. Use this when there are many prompts or large ones.
- .env.example: An example .env file - specify each variable that the user will need to fill in and a quick comment above each one for how to do so.
- requirements.txt: Don't include any versions, just the top level package names needed for the agent.

~~ INSTRUCTIONS: ~~

- Don't ask the user before taking an action, just do it. Always make sure you look at the documentation with the provided tools before writing any code.
- When you first look at the documentation, always start with RAG.
Then also always check the list of available documentation pages and retrieve the content of page(s) if it'll help.
- Always let the user know when you didn't find the answer in the documentation or the right URL - be honest.
- Helpful tip: when starting a new AI agent build, it's a good idea to look at the 'weather agent' in the docs as an example.
- When starting a new AI agent build, always produce the full code for the AI agent - never tell the user to finish a tool/function.
- When refining an existing AI agent build in a conversation, just share the code changes necessary.
- Each time you respond to the user, ask them to let you know either if they need changes or the code looks good.

ChatGPT said:
Reasoned for 13 seconds

Below is a concrete set of recommendations and next-step improvements, taking into account the current Archon V2 layout and code. The aim is to help you build toward a more “master orchestrator” system that can plug in new tools, spin up specialized sub-agents, integrate with GUIs like n8n or Auto-GPT frontends, and self-heal when errors occur.

1. Strengthen the Core “Agentic” Framework
a. Clear Separation of Concerns

Currently, your code is well-structured around:

An archon_graph.py that defines the LangGraph workflow and orchestrates the main steps.

A pydantic_ai_coder.py that handles the coding agent and relevant RAG logic.

A documentation crawler (crawl_pydantic_ai_docs.py) for your vector store.

To make the architecture even clearer, consider extracting the high-level orchestration logic (the “master agent” role) into its own “orchestrator.py” (or similar) that:

Manages session state and sub-agent creation.

Decides which specialized agents to spin up for new tasks.

Defines a plugin registry (more on that below).

By isolating all major orchestration logic from “agent-specific” code or documentation crawling code, you ensure that adding new sub-agents (e.g., a “UI Builder Agent” or “Tool-Generator Agent”) will not require deep modifications to your existing files.

b. Agent Profiles / Roles

Introduce a typed, consistent way to declare an agent’s role, tools, and possible states. For example, a BaseAgentProfile Pydantic model that includes:

class BaseAgentProfile(BaseModel):
    name: str
    role_description: str
    available_tools: List[str]  # or references to tool classes
    memory_config: dict
    ...


Then each specialized agent (Reasoner, Router, Coder, etc.) can have its own profile. This structure can also be extended with dynamic loading (e.g., from a JSON config) so you can create new agent types without modifying core code.

2. Making it Easier to Add & Use Tools
a. Plugin System for Tools

Currently, your “tools” are implemented as async functions decorated with @pydantic_ai_coder.tool in pydantic_ai_coder.py. That works well for small numbers of built-in tools, but as your system grows to dozens or hundreds of tools (e.g., connecting to Slack, HubSpot, n8n, local file operations, etc.), you’ll want a more plugin-based approach:

Tool Base Class – Define a ToolPlugin or BaseTool with attributes like name, description, run() method, etc.

Auto-Discovery – You can store each tool in a tools folder. At runtime, your “master orchestrator” can scan that folder (and subfolders) for .py files that implement the plugin interface and register them automatically.

Dependency Isolation – Some tools might require extra dependencies. You could keep them optional by having a separate requirements-toolname.txt, or by using a plugin manager that checks for missing libraries at load time.

b. Automated “Tool Generation Agent”

You mentioned a desire for an agent that can spin up new tools whenever it sees a new idea or service to integrate. This “Tool Developer Agent” could:

Read new API docs or user requests (e.g., “We need a Twilio integration.”).

Scaffold a new tool_twilio.py plugin, with all the relevant code, docstrings, and input schemas.

Write tests for it.

Register the tool with your orchestrator automatically (or at least prompt you to approve it).

You can rely on the existing “Coding Agent” capabilities (in pydantic_ai_coder.py) to produce code, but give it a specialized prompt and system instructions to say “Now create a new plugin named tool_twilio.py with a send_sms function,” etc.

3. Integrating a GUI or Low-Code Environment (n8n, Node-RED, Auto-GPT, etc.)
a. n8n Integration

Create a Custom n8n Node that calls your orchestrator’s HTTP endpoint. This node might accept:

The high-level user request (“Build a new Slack + CRM integration agent.”)

A JSON payload describing any agent profile or existing scope.

Bidirectional Communication – If your orchestrator needs user input mid-workflow, you can pass it back to n8n, prompting the user in the n8n interface, and then continue.

This approach allows non-technical users to compose flows visually in n8n and only hand off the “AI Orchestration” steps to Archon.

b. Streamlit / Web UI Enhancements

You already have a streamlit_ui.py that can query documentation and show partial results. You could expand that to a multi-page Streamlit app, providing:

Project Dashboard – Summaries of ongoing “agent-building” tasks, logs, sub-agents created, error states.

Tool Management – A page that lists all the loaded tools, allows enabling/disabling them, or configures credentials.

Workflow Editor – Possibly a simple DAG or step-based UI, letting users chain tasks (like an internal n8n).

c. Integration with Auto-GPT or AgentGPT

If you want to incorporate “Auto-GPT”-style chains of thought, you could unify your system with a multi-agent approach: The “Auto-GPT” or “planner” agent and your existing “Coder,” “Reasoner,” “Router,” etc. That said, be mindful that standard Auto-GPT is quite open-ended; your approach is more structured with Pydantic-based validation. So a hybrid design might yield the best of both worlds.

4. Error Handling & Resilience
a. Retry & Fallback

Use LangGraph features or your own logic to handle partial failures:

Retry – If a tool fails, attempt a fallback approach or a limited number of retries.

Diagnostic Agent – If repeated failures occur, pass the logs and error messages to a “Diagnostic Agent” that tries to figure out the cause (invalid API keys, schema mismatch, etc.) and propose a fix.

b. Structured Logging & Observability

Logs are crucial for debugging multi-agent workflows:

Use structured JSON logs (with a correlation ID / session ID) so each user request can be traced across sub-agents.

Store logs in a time-series DB or a dedicated logging service (e.g., Grafana Loki or Elastic Stack) if you want dashboards.

Consider capturing each “run” or “conversation” in a Supabase table, or storing them in a vector DB for future meta-analysis (like, “What were the most common errors last month?”).

c. Persistent Knowledge / Self-Healing

You can store “lessons learned” in a knowledge base or vector DB. For example, every time you fix an error manually, you could have a short “post-mortem” summary that your orchestrator can recall if it sees a similar error. This is more advanced, but can pay off as your system grows more complex.

5. Continuous Learning & Database Integration
a. Local or Remote DB for Interaction Logs

Your existing Supabase usage focuses on storing documentation pages and embeddings. Consider adding a table or schema for:

Agent Interaction Logs – Each row describing the user’s request, the chain of calls, any errors, final results.

Tool Usage Stats – Which tools got invoked, how often, average success rate, latencies, etc.

b. Domain-Specific Knowledge

If you want your system to “learn” about a particular business domain (e.g., marketing automation), keep an up-to-date knowledge base for that domain so the agent can do RAG queries against domain specs, historical usage data, or standard operating procedures.

c. Custom Data Formats

You may want the system to store intermediate states (like partial agent code, partial workflow definitions, test results) in a structured format. This lets you retrieve them for debugging or re-inject them into the agent’s context later.

6. Scaling & Deployment
a. Containerization and Orchestration (Proxmox, Docker, etc.)

Leverage your Proxmox cluster to run Archon in containers or VMs, with:

Separate Services – e.g., one container for your orchestrator, one for the DB, one for the vector store, etc.

Load Balancing – If your “master orchestrator” gets hammered with requests, scale horizontally.

b. Resource-Hungry Inference

If you incorporate GPU-based local models, consider a separate container or node that handles large-scale inference, leaving your orchestrator container more lightweight.

c. Monitoring & Metrics

Use a combination of logs, metrics, and alerting (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana) to see CPU usage, memory usage, GPU usage, request volumes, etc.

7. Roadmap for “Game-Changing” Goals

Below is a distilled roadmap, tying it all together:

Refactor & Plugin Architecture

Move all “tools” into a plugins/ directory or a similarly named folder.

Create a plugin registration system that automatically loads new tools.

Master Orchestrator

Extract the high-level logic from archon_graph.py into an orchestrator.py that can create sub-agents, pass them tasks, gather results, and handle repeated errors or user prompts.

GUI Integration

Build a simple RESTful or GraphQL API in front of your orchestrator so that n8n or any other system can interact with Archon easily.

(Optional) Write a custom n8n node that calls this API, letting users visually chain “Archon tasks” with other data sources or triggers.

Enhanced Error Handling & Self-Healing

Add robust retry logic and a specialized “Diagnostic Agent” to handle repeated errors.

Store errors, conversation logs, and “lessons learned” in the DB.

Automated Tool Generator

Create a specialized agent that, given an API doc or user request, auto-generates a new tool plugin.

Integrate it with a test harness (maybe Pytest) to confirm the new tool’s correctness.

Knowledge Database & Continuous Learning

Expand your Supabase DB usage to store not just doc embeddings, but also logs, usage stats, error patterns, etc.

Build an “insights” or “critic” agent that periodically looks at the DB for patterns to improve or to flag frequent user requests that are not well-supported.

Scaling & Deployment

Containerize each key component (orchestrator, DB, vector store) for better resource management in Proxmox.

Optionally add an advanced LLM “GPU node” in the cluster if you want to run local large models.

By following these steps, you’ll move steadily toward a framework where a single user command (“Build me an agent that integrates Slack, checks data in my CRM, and sends daily summary emails.”) triggers a sequence of specialized sub-agents. They’ll crawl documentation, spin up code for the new tools if necessary, confirm correctness (tests), handle partial errors gracefully, and ultimately produce a fully tested, functioning solution—complete with an optional GUI and easy customization.

This approach positions Archon V2 not just as a single multi-step agent, but as an extensible platform that can run continuously, handle dynamic expansions of capabilities, and learn from its own successes and failures.

Reasoned for a second

Below are some suggestions and next-step improvements, tailored specifically to the code and structure you shared. These aim to help you transition Archon V2 into a more resilient, extensible “master orchestrator” capable of handling multiple tools, spinning up sub-agents, handling errors gracefully, and optionally integrating with a GUI like n8n or any other low/no-code front-end.

1. Refine the “Agentic Flow” Orchestration
a. Extract Orchestrator Logic

archon_graph.py contains your main LangGraph logic. Currently, it’s well structured for a single user journey (scope → coder_agent → user input → route → either continue or finish).

To grow beyond this linear flow, consider splitting out a dedicated “orchestrator” Python module (e.g., orchestrator.py) that:

Manages high-level session state (e.g., multiple parallel tasks).

Decides which nodes or sub-agents to spin up dynamically.

Directly invokes your compiled LangGraph(s) or subgraphs when needed.

This would let you easily add new subflows (e.g., a “Tool Generation” subflow, a “Test Runner” subflow, etc.) without crowding a single file.

b. Expand “AgentState” Schema or Create Multiple State Schemas

Currently, your AgentState includes latest_user_message, messages, and scope.

As you introduce more sub-agents or tasks, you might need a more modular approach. For instance, define separate typed dictionaries or Pydantic models for each subflow (e.g., “ToolGeneratorState” vs. “CoderAgentState”), or define a single richer state model with optional fields.

c. Multi-Agent or Hierarchical Patterns

You already have separate Agents for reasoner, router, coder, and finishing conversation. This is a good start toward a multi-agent approach.

Eventually, you could allow them to talk to each other in a more asynchronous / event-driven way (e.g., each agent can publish “tasks” to a queue, which the orchestrator picks up and routes).

2. Tool (Plugin) Architecture
a. Move Tools from pydantic_ai_coder.py to a plugins/ Folder

Right now, your tool definitions (retrieve_relevant_documentation, list_documentation_pages, etc.) live in pydantic_ai_coder.py. That’s fine for this early stage but can become unwieldy as you add more. Instead:

Create a plugins/ or tools/ directory.

Keep each tool in its own file or group them by category (e.g., documentation_tools.py, api_tools.py, etc.).

Provide an init_tools() function or plugin registry that loads them on startup, using either a simple import or a more dynamic discovery approach (e.g., scanning for modules that define a @pydantic_ai_tool decorator).

b. Automated Tool Generator

Create a new sub-agent that, given a user’s request for a new integration (e.g., “Build me a Twilio tool so I can send SMS messages from my AI agent.”), scaffolds a new plugin file. The agent would:

Identify relevant docs or example code for the new integration.

Write a Python file implementing a ToolPlugin class or set of tool functions.

(Optional) Run Pytest or a similar test harness to confirm it’s working.

c. Granular Access Control

If you incorporate sensitive or potentially expensive operations (e.g., calling third-party APIs with costs), you might want a permission system for each tool, so the orchestrator can decide which agent has the authority to run certain tools.

3. Error Handling & Resilience
a. Retry Logic

In archon_graph.py, consider adding a small wrapper around each node function that catches exceptions, logs them, and tries to retry or escalate to a “diagnostic agent.”

b. Diagnostic Agent for Failures

You can define a “Diagnostic Node” that triggers whenever a sub-agent fails multiple times. It could:

Summarize the error context (logs, stack traces, user input).

Pass that summary to a “Self-Healing Agent” or even the user for further instructions.

c. Logging & Telemetry

You’re using Logfire for logs. Ensure the logs for each sub-agent are structured (e.g., JSON with keys like agent_name, timestamp, error_msg, etc.) so you can easily search or visualize them in your logging solution.

4. Integration with GUIs (Streamlit, n8n, etc.)
a. Streamlit Enhancements

The streamlit_ui.py is good for a simple chat-style interface. You can expand it to:

Show logs or a partial “debug view” for the tasks the system is currently running.

Let the user pick or enable/disable certain sub-agents or plugins at runtime.

Offer a “Tasks & Agents” tab to see which sub-agents are active, what messages they’ve processed, etc.

b. n8n Node

To integrate with n8n, define a custom node that calls an Archon API endpoint. The node can send the user’s prompt to the orchestrator, then wait for an answer or partial updates (via a webhook or event callback). This node could be used as a step in an automation workflow: “When new data arrives from an API, pass it to the Archon orchestrator for AI-driven processing, then do X with the result.”

c. Auto-GPT / AgentGPT

If you want a more “open-ended” approach, you can incorporate the chain-of-thought style from Auto-GPT. That said, your existing architecture with Pydantic validation is more structured (which is generally a good thing). You could embed an “Auto-GPT-like” step as a specialized sub-agent that does “planning,” but still keep the rest of the system strongly typed and validated.

5. Database & Continuous Learning
a. Additional Tables

You have site_pages storing doc chunks. Add a table for “agent_runs” or “conversation logs”:

create table agent_runs (
  id bigserial primary key,
  session_id varchar not null,
  agent_name varchar not null,
  user_input text,
  agent_output text,
  error_message text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);


Store each sub-agent invocation or node step here. This makes it easier to trace a conversation or debug errors.

b. RAG for “Lessons Learned”

If you store run history and error messages, you could feed them back as an “internal knowledge base” for your system’s future runs. If the orchestrator sees repeated patterns or errors, it can consult that knowledge base to see if a workaround or fix was previously found.

c. Local LLM for Embeddings

You mention eventually dropping the reliance on OpenAI for embeddings. Tools like text-generation-webui or smaller local embedding models (e.g., Instructor, sentence-transformers) can be integrated when you’re ready to reduce external calls. You’d just need to update your embedding function in crawl_pydantic_ai_docs.py and any place you do openai_client.embeddings.create(...).

6. Scaling & Deployment
a. Containerization with Proxmox

Since you have a Proxmox cluster, consider containerizing each piece (orchestrator, vector DB, crawler, etc.).

You can define a Docker Compose or build an LXC template that includes the environment plus your .env.example instructions.

b. Monitoring & Observability

Tools like Grafana + Prometheus or Elastic Stack can track resource usage, request latencies, or error rates.

You can build a quick dashboard to see how many calls each agent or plugin handles per hour, how many result in errors, etc.

7. Putting It All Together: A Sample Roadmap

Refactor

Move orchestrator logic to a dedicated file.

Create a plugins/ folder to hold tool definitions separately.

Agent Roles

Introduce a consistent agent profile model (with Pydantic) for the reasoner, router, coder, and any new sub-agents.

Add a “Tool Generator” sub-agent

This sub-agent automatically scaffolds new plugin code given an API doc or user request.

Error Handling

Implement a “Diagnostic Node” in the LangGraph that triggers on repeated failures, passing context to a “Self-Healing Agent.”

GUI Integration

Expand your Streamlit UI or create an n8n node. Possibly both, if you want to serve different user groups.

Database & Logging

Add more tables to store usage stats, logs, or error events.

Optionally push logs to an external aggregator for analytics.

Deployment

Containerize each piece.

Use Proxmox for resource management, scaling, or GPU-based local LLM usage if needed.

Following these steps, you’ll transform Archon V2 into a more comprehensive, modular platform that can:

Spin up specialized agents for tasks (reasoning, coding, new tool generation, error diagnosis).

Integrate seamlessly with third-party GUIs or workflow tools (Streamlit, n8n).

Gradually “learn” from usage data, storing logs and referencing them in future runs.

Scale horizontally across your Proxmox cluster, with robust error handling and logging.

Reasoned for 4 seconds

Below is a prioritized to-do list for evolving Archon V2 into a more robust, modular, and extensible “master orchestrator” system. Following the list, you’ll find the first coding step (Task #1) with a sample refactor to move your orchestration logic from archon_graph.py into a new orchestrator.py file.

To-Do List (Prioritized)

Refactor Orchestrator Logic

Goal: Separate the high-level orchestration (the “master agent” flow) from the existing LangGraph state machine.

Outcome: A new orchestrator.py that creates and manages sub-agents (Reasoner, Router, Coder, etc.).

Priority: High (foundation for everything else).

Create a Plugin Architecture for Tools

Goal: Move tool definitions out of pydantic_ai_coder.py into a plugins/ (or tools/) directory.

Outcome: A simple plugin loader or registry that automatically detects tool modules, registers them, and makes them available to the orchestrator.

Priority: High (enables easy extension).

Implement Error Handling & Diagnostic Agent

Goal: If any node fails repeatedly, pass context to a “Diagnostic Agent” that attempts self-healing steps or user guidance.

Outcome: Prevent single errors from crashing the entire flow; improved reliability and maintainability.

Priority: High (critical for robustness).

Add a “Tool Generator” Sub-Agent

Goal: Automatically generate new plugin files when the user requests a new integration (e.g., Twilio, Slack, HubSpot).

Outcome: Accelerate feature development; reduce manual coding.

Priority: Medium (builds on the plugin architecture).

Enhance Streamlit UI / Integrate with n8n

Goal: Provide a user-friendly front end to orchestrate tasks, track sub-agents, see logs, or visually link steps in a flow.

Outcome: Broader accessibility for non-developers; easy workflow building.

Priority: Medium (adds convenience, but not essential for core system logic).

Database & Logging Improvements

Goal: Add tables (e.g., agent_runs) for storing conversation logs, sub-agent usage, error messages, and “lessons learned.”

Outcome: Persistent session tracking, advanced analytics, RAG-based “self-improvement.”

Priority: Medium (unlocks continuous learning, helpful for debugging).

Deployment & Scaling with Proxmox

Goal: Containerize or orchestrate the system (orchestrator, vector DB, crawler, etc.) for better scalability.

Outcome: Ability to handle larger workloads or multiple concurrent tasks; easy environment management.

Priority: Lower (infrastructure-level improvement).

Start Coding: Task #1 – Refactor Orchestrator Logic

Below is an example of how you can refactor your “master agent” flow from archon_graph.py into a new orchestrator.py file. This includes:

A new Orchestrator class for controlling the main workflow.

A short, revised archon_graph.py that primarily defines your LangGraph nodes, but not the high-level orchestration.

Feel free to adjust names, folder paths, or method signatures to fit your actual codebase.

1. Create a New File: orchestrator.py
# orchestrator.py

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.types import interrupt

# Import your existing agents and typed state from archon_graph, or define them here
from archon_graph import (

    coder_agent,                 # your node function
    finish_conversation,         # your node function
    route_user_message,
    AgentState
)

class Orchestrator:
    """
    Manages the high-level flow of tasks among your sub-agents
    and provides methods for external calls to start or resume workflows.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = MemorySaver()
        self.graph = self._build_graph()

    def _build_graph(self) -> StateGraph:
        builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

        builder.add_node("define_scope_with_reasoner", define_scope_with_reasoner)
        builder.add_node("coder_agent", coder_agent)
        builder.add_node("get_next_user_message", self.get_next_user_message)  # local method
        builder.add_node("finish_conversation", finish_conversation)

        # Define edges
        builder.add_edge(START, "define_scope_with_reasoner")
        builder.add_edge("define_scope_with_reasoner", "coder_agent")
        builder.add_edge("coder_agent", "get_next_user_message")

        builder.add_conditional_edges(

        )

        return builder.compile(checkpointer=self.memory)

    def get_next_user_message(self, state: AgentState):
        """
        This function interrupts the graph to wait for the next user input.

        """
        value = interrupt({})
        return {
            "latest_user_message": value
        }

    def start_flow(self, user_message: str):
        """
        Kick off the workflow. Called once at the beginning of a new conversation/task.
        """
        initial_state: AgentState = {
            "latest_user_message": user_message,
            "messages": [],
            "scope": ""
        }
        return self.graph.run(initial_state)

    def resume_flow(self, user_message: str):
        """
        Resume the workflow after an interruption (waiting for user input).
        """
        return self.graph.run(user_message)



Key Points

Orchestrator Class – Encapsulates the entire workflow creation and memory handling.

start_flow – Starts a brand-new conversation.

resume_flow – Called when the user provides the next message after an interruption.

You still rely on the same node functions (define_scope_with_reasoner, etc.), but you move the control of how the graph is built into Orchestrator.

2. Simplify archon_graph.py

Now, archon_graph.py can just hold your node functions, agents, and typed state definition. It no longer needs to build or run the full graph:

    return {"messages": [result.new_messages_json()]}


Key Points

archon_graph.py no longer compiles or runs the graph; it only defines the building blocks (agents, node functions, typed state).

The orchestrator has full responsibility for constructing and running the flow.

3. Update Your streamlit_ui.py or Other Entry Points

Wherever you previously imported agentic_flow from archon_graph.py, you now import the Orchestrator and call start_flow() or resume_flow() as needed. For example:

# streamlit_ui.py (simplified snippet)

from orchestrator import Orchestrator

orchestrator = Orchestrator()

async def run_agent_with_streaming(user_input: str):
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}

    # If this is the very first user message:
    if len(st.session_state.messages) == 1:
        # Start a new flow
        async for msg in orchestrator.start_flow(user_input):
            yield msg
    else:
        # Resume an existing flow
        async for msg in orchestrator.resume_flow(user_input):
            yield msg


Now your code is more organized:

archon_graph.py = node definitions + sub-agents

orchestrator.py = the “master orchestrator” that builds and runs the LangGraph flow

streamlit_ui.py (or any other UI) = picks which orchestrator method to call, based on user input

Next Steps

Verify this refactor doesn’t break any references. You may need to adjust imports or rename functions for consistency.

Test that your streaming approach still works as expected with the new orchestrator structure.

Once you confirm this step is stable, you can move on to Task #2 (creating a plugin architecture for your tools), then Task #3 (error handling with a diagnostic agent), etc.

Summary

You now have:

A prioritized to-do list to guide your improvements.

A first step in code (extracting orchestration logic to orchestrator.py), establishing a cleaner separation of concerns.

Implementing this refactor lays a strong foundation for the subsequent tasks (plugin system, better error handling, new sub-agents, and more). If you run into any issues or want to proceed to Task #2, let me know!

Title: Refactor Archon V2 Into a More Modular “Master Orchestrator” System

Overview

We want to evolve Archon V2 into a more robust, modular, and extensible agent framework—capable of handling multiple sub-agents, a wide variety of tools, and smarter error handling. Below is a prioritized to-do list outlining the steps needed to achieve this goal, plus details on how to proceed with the first major refactor.

To-Do List (Prioritized)

Refactor Orchestrator Logic

Goal: Separate high-level orchestration (the “master agent”) from the individual nodes and sub-agents currently defined in archon_graph.py.

Outcome: A new orchestrator.py to handle flow creation, memory state, and sub-agent orchestration.

Priority: High (foundation for further work).

Create a Plugin Architecture for Tools

Goal: Move tool definitions out of pydantic_ai_coder.py into a dedicated plugins/ (or tools/) directory.

Outcome: A simple plugin loader or registry that auto-detects tool modules, making them easily reusable and extensible.

Priority: High (enables quick addition or removal of tools).

Implement Error Handling & Diagnostic Agent

Goal: If a node or sub-agent fails repeatedly, pass context to a “Diagnostic Agent” that attempts self-healing or user guidance.

Outcome: Prevention of entire flow failures; improved reliability and debugging.

Priority: High (critical for production-ready stability).

Add a “Tool Generator” Sub-Agent

Goal: Automatically generate new plugin files for external integrations (e.g., Twilio, Slack) when requested by the user.

Outcome: Rapid expansion of capabilities and less manual coding for new services.

Priority: Medium (depends on plugin architecture).

Enhance Streamlit UI / Integrate with n8n

Goal: Provide a user-friendly interface to orchestrate tasks, show logs, and possibly visually link subflows.

Outcome: Broader accessibility for non-developers; potential “drag-and-drop” automation via n8n nodes.

Priority: Medium (quality-of-life improvement).

Database & Logging Improvements

Goal: Add tables (e.g., agent_runs) for storing conversation logs, sub-agent usage, error messages, and “lessons learned” for RAG.

Outcome: Persistent session tracking, advanced analytics, and potential continuous learning.

Priority: Medium (helps debugging and analytics).

Deployment & Scaling with Proxmox

Goal: Containerize or orchestrate (orchestrator + vector DB + crawler, etc.) in a Proxmox cluster.

Outcome: Allows horizontal scaling, environment isolation, and easier resource allocation for heavier workloads.

Priority: Lower (infrastructure enhancement).

First Step: Refactor Orchestrator Logic
Summary

The first coding step is to extract the orchestration logic out of archon_graph.py into a new file (e.g., orchestrator.py). This will make archon_graph.py focus only on:

Defining sub-agents (Reasoner, Router, Coder, etc.)

Declaring node functions and their typed states

Meanwhile, orchestrator.py will handle:

Building the StateGraph

Compiling it with a memory saver

Exposing methods like start_flow() and resume_flow()

        return self.graph.run(initial_state)

    def resume_flow(self, user_message: str):

# - Keep your typed state (AgentState)
# - Remove references to .compile() or .run() because that's now in orchestrator.py

</details>
Next Steps

Once this refactor is tested and stable:

Implement Task #2: Create a directory for plugins and move all existing “tools” out of pydantic_ai_coder.py.

Implement Task #3: Add robust error handling and a “Diagnostic Agent” node if repeated failures occur.

With these changes, Archon V2 can more easily scale, incorporate new features, and handle complex multi-agent workflows.

ok lets get to coding - where should we start? Begin.

Reasoned for a few seconds

Below is a step-by-step guide to begin the “Refactor Orchestrator Logic” task. We’ll walk through creating the new orchestrator.py file, updating archon_graph.py to remove orchestration-specific code, and ensuring your entry points (like streamlit_ui.py) still function with the new design.

1. Create orchestrator.py

In your project’s iterations/v2-agentic-workflow directory (or whichever directory you currently have archon_graph.py in), create a new file named orchestrator.py.

Below is an example implementation that:

Defines an Orchestrator class.

Builds and compiles the LangGraph flow (with memory saving).

Exposes two main methods:

start_flow(user_message) – For starting a brand-new session.

resume_flow(user_message) – For continuing after waiting on user input.

Paste in the following code:

# orchestrator.py

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.types import interrupt

# Import node functions & typed state from archon_graph:
#   - define_scope_with_reasoner
#   - coder_agent
#   - finish_conversation
#   - route_user_message
#   - AgentState
from archon_graph import (
    define_scope_with_reasoner,
    coder_agent,
    finish_conversation,
    route_user_message,
    AgentState
)

class Orchestrator:
    """
    The 'master orchestrator' that constructs the workflow graph and runs it.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        # We store the MemorySaver so that the LangGraph state can persist across runs
        self.memory = MemorySaver()
        self.graph = self._build_graph()

    def _build_graph(self):
        """
        Construct and compile the LangGraph flow, specifying which node
        functions appear and how they connect.
        """
        builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

        # Add nodes
        builder.add_node("define_scope_with_reasoner", define_scope_with_reasoner)
        builder.add_node("coder_agent", coder_agent)
        builder.add_node("get_next_user_message", self.get_next_user_message)
        builder.add_node("finish_conversation", finish_conversation)

        # Set up edges
        builder.add_edge(START, "define_scope_with_reasoner")
        builder.add_edge("define_scope_with_reasoner", "coder_agent")
        builder.add_edge("coder_agent", "get_next_user_message")

        builder.add_conditional_edges(
            "get_next_user_message",
            route_user_message,
            {"coder_agent": "coder_agent", "finish_conversation": "finish_conversation"}
        )

        builder.add_edge("finish_conversation", END)

        # Compile the workflow
        return builder.compile(checkpointer=self.memory)

    def get_next_user_message(self, state: AgentState):
        """
        Interrupt the flow and wait for user input (via .resume_flow).
        This function is called by the graph after coder_agent finishes.
        """
        value = interrupt({})
        return {"latest_user_message": value}

    def start_flow(self, user_message: str):
        """
        Begin a new conversation from scratch.
        """
        initial_state = {
            "latest_user_message": user_message,
            "messages": [],
            "scope": ""
        }
        return self.graph.run(initial_state)

    def resume_flow(self, user_message: str):
        """
        Resume the conversation after we have user input (like in a Streamlit or n8n UI).
        """
        return self.graph.run(user_message)


Key Points

interrupt({}) stops the workflow until you call resume_flow() with the user’s next input.

This class will be your new entry point for controlling the entire agentic workflow.

2. Update archon_graph.py

Now that orchestrator.py owns the logic for building and running the flow, remove the graph-compilation parts from archon_graph.py. Keep only:

The typed state (AgentState).

Your Async node functions (define_scope_with_reasoner, coder_agent, finish_conversation, etc.).

The specialized agents (reasoner, router_agent, end_conversation_agent)—but not the flow-building code.

Example of a minimal archon_graph.py:

# archon_graph.py

from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Agents
base_url = os.getenv('BASE_URL', 'https://api.openai.com/v1')
api_key = os.getenv('LLM_API_KEY', 'no-llm-api-key-provided')

reasoner_llm_model = os.getenv('REASONER_MODEL', 'o3-mini')
reasoner = Agent(
    OpenAIModel(reasoner_llm_model, base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key),
    system_prompt="You are an expert at coding AI agents with Pydantic AI..."
)

primary_llm_model = os.getenv('PRIMARY_MODEL', 'gpt-4o-mini')
router_agent = Agent(
    OpenAIModel(primary_llm_model, base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key),
    system_prompt="Your job is to route the user message..."
)

end_conversation_agent = Agent(
    OpenAIModel(primary_llm_model, base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key),
    system_prompt="Your job is to end a conversation..."
)

# This typed dictionary defines the shape of state that flows through the graph
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    latest_user_message: str
    messages: Annotated[List[bytes], lambda x, y: x + y]
    scope: str

# Node function: define the scope with the reasoner
async def define_scope_with_reasoner(state: AgentState):
    # Implementation from your original code...
    # ...
    return {"scope": scope}

# Node function: main coder agent
async def coder_agent(state: AgentState, writer=None):
    # Implementation from your original code...
    # ...
    return {"messages": [result.new_messages_json()]}

# Node function: route user message to either continue coding or finish
async def route_user_message(state: AgentState):
    # Implementation from your original code...
    # ...
    return "coder_agent"  # or "finish_conversation"

# Node function: finish conversation
async def finish_conversation(state: AgentState, writer=None):
    # Implementation from your original code...
    # ...
    return {"messages": [result.new_messages_json()]}


Note:

No calls to StateGraph(...) or .compile() remain here.

The orchestrator now does that in orchestrator.py.

3. Adjust Your Entry Points (e.g., streamlit_ui.py)

Anywhere you previously used something like agentic_flow.run(...) or agentic_flow.astream(...) from archon_graph.py, you’ll now instantiate and call methods on your new Orchestrator class.

For instance, if your streamlit_ui.py was referencing agentic_flow, replace it with code like this:

# streamlit_ui.py

import streamlit as st
import asyncio
from orchestrator import Orchestrator

orchestrator = Orchestrator()

async def run_agent_with_streaming(user_input: str):
    if len(st.session_state.messages) == 1:
        # Start a new flow
        async for partial_output in orchestrator.start_flow(user_input):
            yield partial_output
    else:
        # Resume existing flow
        async for partial_output in orchestrator.resume_flow(user_input):
            yield partial_output


Then the rest of your Streamlit logic (displaying user messages, updating chat history) can remain the same. The main difference is that you call orchestrator.start_flow(...) or orchestrator.resume_flow(...) instead of referencing agentic_flow.

4. Test and Validate

Install or update any missing dependencies.

Run your Streamlit UI or whichever entry point you use.

Try a sample conversation.

On the first user prompt, it should call start_flow.

Then after you see the “interruption” for user input, the next message should go through resume_flow.

If everything is wired correctly, your existing workflow should remain functional—except now it’s clearer and easier to extend.

5. What’s Next?
a. Verify This Refactor

Ensure no references to the old agentic_flow remain, and confirm that the orchestrator’s memory saving is functioning as intended.

b. Move on to Plugin Architecture (Task #2)

Create a plugins/ or tools/ folder for new tools. Move the retrieve_relevant_documentation, list_documentation_pages, etc., from pydantic_ai_coder.py into separate plugin files. Add a simple loader that loops over files in plugins/ and registers them.

c. Add Diagnostic Agent (Task #3)

Enhance resilience by building a “Diagnostic Agent” to handle repeated errors and propose solutions or self-healing steps.

Wrap-Up

With this orchestrator refactor complete, you’ll have laid the foundation for a truly modular system—making it straightforward to add new sub-agents, error-handling, and advanced features.

Ready for the next steps? Let me know if you hit any snags or want to proceed with building the plugin architecture!

            }
        )

        builder.add_edge("finish_conversation", END)

        # Compile the workflow
        return builder.compile(checkpointer=self.memory)

    def get_next_user_message(self, state: AgentState):

        return self.graph.run(user_message)

2. archon_graph.py (Updated File)

Below is a minimal example, showing the node functions and agents only. We’ve removed any calls to StateGraph(...) or .compile(). If you have additional logic in your original file, keep it—just ensure you remove the flow-building portion.

# archon_graph.py

from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Agents
base_url = os.getenv('BASE_URL', 'https://api.openai.com/v1')
api_key = os.getenv('LLM_API_KEY', 'no-llm-api-key-provided')

reasoner_llm_model = os.getenv('REASONER_MODEL', 'o3-mini')
reasoner = Agent(
    OpenAIModel(reasoner_llm_model, base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key),
    system_prompt="You are an expert at coding AI agents with Pydantic AI..."
)

primary_llm_model = os.getenv('PRIMARY_MODEL', 'gpt-4o-mini')
router_agent = Agent(
    OpenAIModel(primary_llm_model, base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key),
    system_prompt="Your job is to route the user message..."
)

end_conversation_agent = Agent(
    OpenAIModel(primary_llm_model, base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key),
    system_prompt="Your job is to end a conversation..."
)

# This typed dictionary defines the shape of the state that flows through the graph
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    latest_user_message: str
    messages: Annotated[List[bytes], lambda x, y: x + y]
    scope: str

# Node function: define the scope with the reasoner
async def define_scope_with_reasoner(state: AgentState):
    """
    Your logic for the reasoner node goes here. Typically:
    1) Possibly fetch documentation pages
    2) Use reasoner.run(...) to create a scope
    3) Return an updated state
    """
    # Example outline (update with your real code):
    user_input = state["latest_user_message"]
    # ... call the reasoner agent ...
    # scope = ...
    # Save the scope to a file or memory if needed
    return {"scope": "<your-scope-here>"}

# Node function: main coder agent
async def coder_agent(state: AgentState, writer=None):
    """

    """
    # Example outline:
    # user_input = state["latest_user_message"]
    # message_history = state["messages"]
    # ...
    # return {"messages": [result.new_messages_json()]}
    return {"messages": []}  # placeholder

# Node function: route user message
async def route_user_message(state: AgentState):
    """
    Uses the router_agent to decide if we 'finish_conversation' or 'coder_agent'.
    """
    user_msg = state["latest_user_message"]
    # Example logic (update with your real code):
    result = await router_agent.run(user_msg)
    if "finish" in result.data.lower():
        return "finish_conversation"
    else:
        return "coder_agent"

# Node function: finish conversation
async def finish_conversation(state: AgentState, writer=None):
    """
    Ends the conversation, possibly giving instructions for how to run the code generated.
    """
    user_msg = state["latest_user_message"]
    # Example logic:
    # result = await end_conversation_agent.run(user_msg)
    # return {"messages": [result.new_messages_json()]}
    return {"messages": []}  # placeholder


Notes:

If you have advanced logic or references to the old agentic_flow, remove them or adapt them.

Ensure that define_scope_with_reasoner, coder_agent, route_user_message, and finish_conversation all remain present as asynchronous node functions.

3. streamlit_ui.py (Updated to Use New Orchestrator)

If your streamlit_ui.py previously imported something like agentic_flow from archon_graph.py, it should now import and instantiate the new Orchestrator from orchestrator.py. Then, in your run_agent_with_streaming function, call either orchestrator.start_flow(user_input) or orchestrator.resume_flow(user_input).

Example snippet with the modified approach:

# streamlit_ui.py

from __future__ import annotations
import streamlit as st
import asyncio
from orchestrator import Orchestrator

# If you need any other imports, like your DB or logs, keep them.
# from openai import AsyncOpenAI
# from supabase import Client

orchestrator = Orchestrator()

@st.cache_resource
def get_thread_id():
    import uuid
    return str(uuid.uuid4())

thread_id = get_thread_id()

async def run_agent_with_streaming(user_input: str):
    # If this is the very first user message (i.e., we only have a single system msg in state),
    # start a new flow
    if len(st.session_state.messages) == 1:
        async for partial_text in orchestrator.start_flow(user_input):
            yield partial_text
    else:
        # Otherwise, resume the flow
        async for partial_text in orchestrator.resume_flow(user_input):
            yield partial_text

def main():
    st.title("Archon - Agent Builder")
    st.write("Describe an AI agent you want to build...")

    if "messages" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.messages = []

    # Show previous messages
    for msg in st.session_state.messages:
        with st.chat_message(msg["type"]):
            st.markdown(msg["content"])

    # Chat input
    user_input = st.chat_input("What do you want to build today?")
    if user_input:
        st.session_state.messages.append({"type": "human", "content": user_input})
        with st.chat_message("user"):
            st.markdown(user_input)

        # Placeholder for streaming output
        response_content = ""
        with st.chat_message("assistant"):
            message_placeholder = st.empty()
            # Stream
            async def handle_stream():
                async for chunk in run_agent_with_streaming(user_input):
                    nonlocal response_content
                    response_content += chunk
                    message_placeholder.markdown(response_content)
            asyncio.run(handle_stream())

        st.session_state.messages.append({"type": "ai", "content": response_content})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())


Key Changes:

Replaced references to agentic_flow.astream(...) with orchestrator.start_flow(...) or orchestrator.resume_flow(...).

Everything else (collecting user input, displaying output) can remain the same.

Final Notes

File Structure

orchestrator.py is new, containing your “master orchestrator.”

archon_graph.py only holds sub-agent definitions, node functions, and typed state.

streamlit_ui.py references Orchestrator instead of building/running the flow itself.

Testing

Make sure your environment variables are still set correctly (from .env).

Run your Streamlit app with streamlit run streamlit_ui.py and test a sample conversation.

If you see any import errors, adjust paths accordingly.

Next Steps

Verify everything runs smoothly.

Move on to building a plugin architecture for your tools, or implement more robust error handling with a “Diagnostic Agent.”

That’s it! These three files show all changes made so far for the orchestrator refactor. If you have any issues or questions, let me know.

Below is Task #2 from our earlier plan—creating a plugin architecture for tools—so you can easily add and remove integrations (Slack, Twilio, custom APIs, etc.) without cluttering your main code or modifying core files like pydantic_ai_coder.py. We’ll walk you through step by step:

Define a “Tool” interface or base class.

Create a plugins/ folder to store each tool in a separate file (or grouped by category).

Build a simple plugin loader that automatically imports and registers any plugin that fits the interface.

Adjust your “Coder Agent” (or wherever you define your main code agent) so it can find and call tools from this registry.

Task #2: Plugin Architecture for Tools
1. Create a plugins/ Folder

In your v2-agentic-workflow directory, create a subfolder called plugins/. This folder will hold individual Python files that define one or more “tools.” For example:

v2-agentic-workflow/
├── orchestrator.py
├── archon_graph.py
├── pydantic_ai_coder.py
├── plugins/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── plugin_manager.py
│   ├── tool_example.py
│   └── ...


Note: An empty __init__.py ensures plugins/ is recognized as a Python package.

2. Define a Base “Tool” Interface

Let’s create a base class that each tool will subclass or implement. This can be minimal, specifying just enough metadata (like name, description, a run method) for your orchestrator or coder agent to call.

Inside plugins/plugin_manager.py (new file), add something like:

# plugins/plugin_manager.py

import inspect
import importlib
import os
from typing import Protocol, Any, Dict, Optional

class Tool(Protocol):
    """
    Base interface for any plugin tool.
    Each plugin must define:
      - a unique name (str)
      - a description (str)
      - a run(...) method to do the actual work
    """
    name: str
    description: str

    def run(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        ...

# We'll keep a registry (dictionary) of tool_name -> tool_class (or instance)
TOOLS_REGISTRY: Dict[str, Tool] = {}

def register_tool(tool: Tool):
    """
    Register a tool instance or class into the global TOOLS_REGISTRY.
    """
    if tool.name in TOOLS_REGISTRY:
        raise ValueError(f"Tool '{tool.name}' is already registered.")
    TOOLS_REGISTRY[tool.name] = tool

def load_plugins(plugins_dir: str):
    """
    Dynamically import all .py files in 'plugins_dir' (except __init__.py and plugin_manager.py).
    Each file can define one or more classes or objects implementing 'Tool'.
    Then call 'register_tool(...)' for each.
    """
    for filename in os.listdir(plugins_dir):
        # Skip non-.py files or special files
        if not filename.endswith(".py"):
            continue
        if filename in ["__init__.py", "plugin_manager.py"]:
            continue

        module_name = filename[:-3]  # strip .py
        module_path = f"{plugins_dir.replace('/', '.')}.{module_name}"

        # Dynamically import
        module = importlib.import_module(module_path)

        # Search for any variables/classes that match the 'Tool' Protocol
        for name, obj in inspect.getmembers(module):
            if inspect.isclass(obj) or inspect.isfunction(obj):
                # We'll do a very loose check: does 'obj' have the attributes 'name', 'description', and 'run'?
                if hasattr(obj, "name") and hasattr(obj, "description") and hasattr(obj, "run"):
                    # Attempt to register it
                    # If it's a class, instantiate it. If it's already an instance, use as is.
                    if inspect.isclass(obj):
                        tool_instance = obj()
                    else:
                        tool_instance = obj

                    # Must have a 'name' attribute
                    if not getattr(tool_instance, "name", None):
                        continue

                    register_tool(tool_instance)

def get_tool_by_name(name: str) -> Optional[Tool]:
    """
    Retrieve a tool by its name from the registry.
    """
    return TOOLS_REGISTRY.get(name)

What This Does

Tool(Protocol) – A minimal “interface” specifying name, description, and run(...).

TOOLS_REGISTRY – A global dictionary that maps tool names to tool objects.

register_tool – Puts a tool in the registry.

load_plugins – Imports every .py file in the plugins/ folder, looks for objects that have name, description, and run, then registers them.

get_tool_by_name – Helper to retrieve a tool from the registry.

Note: This is a simple example. You can make it stricter, e.g., use isinstance(obj, Tool) if you define a real base class instead of a Protocol.

3. Create an Example Tool

In plugins/tool_example.py, define a simple tool that echoes text:

# plugins/tool_example.py

class EchoTool:
    name = "echo_tool"
    description = "Echoes the text back to the user."

    def run(self, text: str) -> str:
        return f"Echo: {text}"


This class has the required attributes: name, description, and run(...). The loader in plugin_manager.py will pick it up automatically.

4. Load Plugins at Startup

Now, whenever your app starts up (e.g., in streamlit_ui.py, main.py, or in orchestrator.py), you can call load_plugins(...) with the path to the plugins folder. For instance, in your main entry point:

# main.py or streamlit_ui.py, near the top-level code
from plugins.plugin_manager import load_plugins

def initialize_system():
    # Load all .py plugin files in the plugins folder
    load_plugins("plugins")
    # You can also do any other system-wide inits here
    print("Plugins loaded.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    initialize_system()
    # Then launch your orchestrator, Streamlit, or whatever else you need

Verifying the Registry

If you put a print(TOOLS_REGISTRY) after load_plugins("plugins"), you should see something like:

{
  "echo_tool": <plugins.tool_example.EchoTool object at 0x7f...>
}

5. Using Tools in the Coder Agent (or Orchestrator)

Now that you have a global registry, you can reference tools from anywhere. For instance, if you want your “Coder Agent” to dynamically call a tool, you can do something like:

# pydantic_ai_coder.py (example usage)

from plugins.plugin_manager import get_tool_by_name

@pydantic_ai_coder.tool
async def call_tool(ctx: RunContext[PydanticAIDeps], tool_name: str, *args) -> str:
    """
    A dynamic tool to call any registered plugin tool by name.
    """
    tool = get_tool_by_name(tool_name)
    if not tool:
        return f"No tool named '{tool_name}' found."
    
    # We assume all tools have a .run(...) method that returns a string
    result = tool.run(*args)
    return str(result)


In this scenario, your AI agent can say something like: “call_tool with tool_name='echo_tool' text='Hello',” and it’ll find and run the EchoTool.

Note: The details vary depending on how you prefer to let your agent(s) discover and call tools.

6. (Optional) Tighter Integration with Pydantic AI Tools

Currently, you have your tools decorated with @pydantic_ai_coder.tool. One approach is:

Keep each “tool function” short, e.g. call_tool(...), which looks up and calls your actual plugin code.

Each plugin can do a different job behind the scenes (Slack API calls, Twilio SMS, etc.).

Alternatively, you can define them directly in each plugin file with a decorator, but you’d still want some mechanism to “load” them into your agent.

Either way: The key is you don’t have to keep every integration in pydantic_ai_coder.py. You can break them out into separate plugin modules.

7. Next Steps & Customizations

Error Handling: If tools can fail or raise exceptions, consider adding a try/except in call_tool(...) to catch errors and return them gracefully.

Credential Storage: For each plugin that hits an external API (Twilio, Slack, etc.), you might store credentials in .env or in a secrets manager. The plugin could read environment variables or get them from your orchestrator.

Plugin Discovery: If you want more advanced scanning (e.g., subdirectories, ignoring certain files), expand load_plugins(...). You can also use Python’s pkgutil.iter_modules([...]) or a library like importlib_metadata.

Permission System (optional): If you want to prevent certain tools from being called automatically by any agent, store a permission level or “agent role” constraints in each plugin, and check those before calling.

Putting It All Together

plugins/plugin_manager.py – A minimal plugin loader, registry, and base Tool interface.

plugins/tool_example.py – A sample plugin.

load_plugins("plugins") – Called once on startup.

Your Agents – They can now call call_tool(tool_name, *args) or reference the registry directly to run any plugin.

With this plugin architecture, your code is cleaner, and adding new integrations (or removing them) is as simple as creating a new .py file in plugins/ or deleting an existing one—no core modifications needed!

Wrap-Up

Congrats! You now have:

A modular way to add and manage tools (Slack, Twilio, local file ops, etc.) without cluttering your main code.

A loadable plugin system that auto-detects new .py files in plugins/.

A quick path to building a “Tool Generator” sub-agent that can automatically create these .py plugin files, register them, and test them (the next step in your roadmap).

If you have any issues or want to see example real-world tools, let me know and we can refine further. Otherwise, you’re ready to proceed—perhaps to build the “Diagnostic Agent” for advanced error handling, or the “Tool Generator” sub-agent that writes new plugin files on demand!

ok proceed

Reasoned for a few seconds

Below is Task #3 from our earlier plan—implementing error handling with a specialized “Diagnostic Agent.” This is a key step in making your system robust and able to handle repeated failures without crashing the entire flow.

We’ll walk through:

Designing a “Diagnostic Agent” that analyzes errors.

Modifying your node functions (or your orchestrator) to catch and track exceptions.

Triggering the Diagnostic Agent if failures accumulate.

Integrating with your existing LangGraph so the workflow can self-heal or at least provide suggestions for resolution.

Task #3: Error Handling & Diagnostic Agent
1. Design the “Diagnostic Agent” & Node
a. Agent Definition

In your archon_graph.py (or a new file), define a new agent, something like this:

# archon_graph.py (or a separate diagnostic_agent.py)

# ...
diagnostic_llm_model = os.getenv('DIAGNOSTIC_MODEL', 'gpt-4o-mini')
diagnostic_agent = Agent(
    OpenAIModel(diagnostic_llm_model, base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key),
    system_prompt="""
You are a Diagnostic Agent. When the system encounters repeated errors, your job is to:
1) Analyze the error context and logs.
2) Suggest likely causes.
3) Propose specific solutions or ask clarifying questions.
"""
)


This new diagnostic_agent can then be called whenever your workflow logic decides a node has failed too many times or thrown an exception.

b. Node Function

We’ll define a node function diagnose_errors that the workflow can jump to if repeated failures occur:

async def diagnose_errors(state: AgentState):
    """
    This node attempts to figure out what's gone wrong, using the 'diagnostic_agent'.
    We'll pass it any recent errors or logs from 'state'.
    """
    error_log = state.get("error_log", [])
    if not error_log:
        # If there's no error_log, we have nothing to diagnose. 
        # We could just return or re-route to a fallback.
        return {}

    # Summarize the last few errors
    error_summary = "\n".join(error_log[-3:])  # last 3 errors

    prompt = f"""
    The system has encountered repeated errors:
    {error_summary}

    Please analyze these errors and suggest possible fixes or clarifications.
    """

    result = await diagnostic_agent.run(prompt)
    # We can store the diagnostic result somewhere in state
    return {"diagnostic_feedback": result.data}


You’ll want to integrate that node function into your flow or orchestrator.

2. Capture and Track Errors
a. Wrap Node Functions

One straightforward approach is to wrap each of your node functions with a small decorator that catches exceptions. If an exception occurs, we log it in the state["error_log"] and either:

Retry the node a certain number of times, or

Move the workflow to the diagnose_errors node if a threshold is reached.

Example decorator:

# error_handling.py (new file, if you like)

import functools
import traceback

def error_handler_decorator(node_name: str, max_retries: int = 1):
    """
    Decorator to catch errors in node functions, store them in state['error_log'],
    and possibly route to 'diagnose_errors' if threshold is reached.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(state, *args, **kwargs):
            # If we haven't set up an error_retries dict, do so
            if "error_retries" not in state:
                state["error_retries"] = {}
            if "error_log" not in state:
                state["error_log"] = []

            # Check how many times we've retried for this node
            attempt = state["error_retries"].get(node_name, 0)

            try:
                result = await func(state, *args, **kwargs)
                # If success, reset retry count for this node
                state["error_retries"][node_name] = 0
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                # Log the error
                trace = traceback.format_exc()
                error_message = f"Error in node '{node_name}': {str(e)}\nTraceback:\n{trace}"
                state["error_log"].append(error_message)
                
                attempt += 1
                state["error_retries"][node_name] = attempt

                if attempt >= max_retries:
                    # Too many retries - route to the diagnostic node
                    return {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"}
                else:
                    # We can either re-run the node or raise to let the flow fail
                    # For now, we'll just re-raise to let the flow fail 
                    # or be handled by higher-level logic
                    raise
        return wrapper
    return decorator

b. Decorate Your Node Functions

Now in archon_graph.py, you can do something like:

from error_handling import error_handler_decorator

@error_handler_decorator("define_scope_with_reasoner", max_retries=2)
async def define_scope_with_reasoner(state: AgentState):
    # existing code ...
    return {"scope": scope}

@error_handler_decorator("coder_agent", max_retries=2)
async def coder_agent(state: AgentState, writer=None):
    # existing code ...
    return {"messages": [result.new_messages_json()]}

@error_handler_decorator("route_user_message", max_retries=1)
async def route_user_message(state: AgentState):
    # existing code ...
    return "coder_agent"  # or "finish_conversation"

@error_handler_decorator("finish_conversation", max_retries=1)
async def finish_conversation(state: AgentState, writer=None):
    # existing code ...
    return {"messages": [result.new_messages_json()]}

@error_handler_decorator("diagnose_errors", max_retries=0)
async def diagnose_errors(state: AgentState):
    error_log = state.get("error_log", [])
    # ...
    return {"diagnostic_feedback": "some diagnostic result"}


Notice we set max_retries=0 for diagnose_errors since we don’t want that node to loop.

c. Handling the “route” Key

In the decorator code, if we exceed max_retries, we return {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"}. We’ll need a small modification in the orchestrator logic to interpret that special key and route accordingly.

3. Integrate Diagnostic Node into the Orchestrator
a. Add the “diagnose_errors” Node

In orchestrator.py:

from archon_graph import diagnose_errors

class Orchestrator:
    ...
    def _build_graph(self):
        builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

        builder.add_node("define_scope_with_reasoner", define_scope_with_reasoner)
        builder.add_node("coder_agent", coder_agent)
        builder.add_node("get_next_user_message", self.get_next_user_message)
        builder.add_node("finish_conversation", finish_conversation)
        builder.add_node("diagnose_errors", diagnose_errors)  # new node

        builder.add_edge(START, "define_scope_with_reasoner")
        builder.add_edge("define_scope_with_reasoner", "coder_agent")
        builder.add_edge("coder_agent", "get_next_user_message")

        builder.add_conditional_edges(
            "get_next_user_message",
            route_user_message,
            {
                "coder_agent": "coder_agent",
                "finish_conversation": "finish_conversation"
            }
        )

        builder.add_edge("finish_conversation", END)
        # We'll also connect the "diagnose_errors" node to END for now
        builder.add_edge("diagnose_errors", END)

        return builder.compile(checkpointer=self.memory)

b. Special Handling of “route” Return

LangGraph automatically checks if a node function returns a special key that maps to a known node. Usually you define explicit edges. If you want to interpret the “route” field from the decorator, ensure the flow can handle it:

builder.add_dynamic_route("__route__")


This instructs LangGraph to dynamically route based on that special field in the node’s return dictionary. If you’re using version 0.2.61+ of LangGraph, you can do something like:

def _build_graph(self):
    ...
    builder.add_dynamic_route("__route__")  # Tells LangGraph to look for __route__ in node results
    ...
    return builder.compile(checkpointer=self.memory)


Now if your node function returns {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"}, the flow automatically moves to the diagnose_errors node.

4. Behavior at Runtime
a. Normal Flow

define_scope_with_reasoner → coder_agent → get_next_user_message → either coder_agent or finish_conversation.

b. Error Encountered

If coder_agent raises an exception, the error_handler_decorator logs it and tries once more (max_retries=2).

If it fails again, it sets __route__ = "diagnose_errors".

Flow jumps to diagnose_errors, which calls your diagnostic_agent and returns a summary in {"diagnostic_feedback": ...}.

The graph then goes to END (or you could reroute it back to get_next_user_message if you want user input after diagnosing).

5. Storing & Displaying Diagnostics

Where do you display the agent’s diagnostics? A few options:

Return to UI: If you’re using Streamlit, you can detect that the flow ended on diagnose_errors and show the user the suggestions.

Log to Database: If you have an agent_runs or error_logs table in Supabase, you can store the diagnostic feedback for future reference.

Self-Healing: If the diagnostic feedback includes recommended code changes or re-try steps, you could parse them and either show them to the user or attempt them automatically.

6. Next Steps

Refine the Decorator – You might want different strategies for different node types or more advanced logic (like exponential backoff or calling the “Diagnostic Agent” for partial solutions).

Expand the Diagnostic Agent – Let it fetch logs from a DB, check for common issues (e.g., credentials missing, network errors), or even attempt code fixes if you integrate with the coder agent.

UI Integration – Present diagnostic results nicely in Streamlit or n8n, prompting the user for next steps.

Centralized Logging – You can write logs to a DB or external service (e.g., Logfire, Grafana, Splunk), then have the Diagnostic Agent query them with RAG for deeper analysis.

Putting It All Together

By combining:

A Diagnostic Agent node,

A decorator that automatically tracks exceptions and logs them in state["error_log"],

A dynamic route in your orchestrator (LangGraph) that re-routes the flow when errors accumulate,

you achieve a robust system that doesn’t crash upon encountering repeated failures. Instead, it:

Logs each failure,

Attempts a configurable number of retries,

Calls a specialized node if still failing,

Generates an intelligent “diagnosis” or “fix proposal.”

This architecture sets you up for more “self-healing” in the future—where your “Diagnostic Agent” might automatically coordinate with the “Coder Agent” to implement suggested fixes on the fly.

Ready to test? Here’s your basic rollout plan:

Create error_handling.py with the decorator.

Add diagnostic_agent to archon_graph.py.

Decorate your existing nodes with @error_handler_decorator(...).

Add the “diagnose_errors” node to the orchestrator and add_dynamic_route("__route__") if necessary.

Check your logs or diagnostic_feedback. Confirm the flow transitions to the “diagnose_errors” node after repeated failures.

That’s it! If you get stuck or want to refine any piece, let me know. Otherwise, you’ve just given Archon the ability to gracefully handle errors and possibly even fix itself—onward to the next milestone!

just let me know and we can continue from there. Let’s make this system as resilient as possible! for 8 seconds

Below is an example diagnostic_agent.py file, fully self-contained, which defines:

A new Diagnostic Agent using your OpenAI-based LLM (or local LLM).

A diagnose_errors node function that retrieves error logs from state and invokes the Diagnostic Agent to analyze them.

We’ll then briefly discuss any necessary updates to other files (like orchestrator.py) so the new diagnostic node can integrate cleanly into your LangGraph flow without causing circular imports.

        return {"diagnostic_feedback": fail_msg}

Key Points

Agent Definition: diagnostic_agent uses its own system prompt so it can be role-played as an “error detective.”

diagnose_errors Node Function:

Reads state["error_log"].

Passes a short prompt to diagnostic_agent.

Returns a dictionary with diagnostic_feedback.

Error Handling: If the Diagnostic Agent itself fails, we catch the exception and embed that info in the return.

Necessary Updates Elsewhere

In archon_graph.py (or a separate states file):

If you want to avoid duplicating AgentState, remove the definition from diagnostic_agent.py and import it from archon_graph.py instead. This helps prevent type mismatch or circular imports. For example:

# diagnostic_agent.py
from archon_graph import AgentState  # Then remove the local typed definition


In orchestrator.py:

Add the new “diagnose_errors” node to the graph. For example:

from diagnostic_agent import diagnose_errors  # Or wherever you put it

class Orchestrator:
    def _build_graph(self):
        builder = StateGraph(AgentState)
        ...
        builder.add_node("diagnose_errors", diagnose_errors)

        # Possibly add a route from some node to "diagnose_errors"
        # e.g. builder.add_edge("some_node", "diagnose_errors")

        # Or if you're using dynamic routing, do:
        builder.add_dynamic_route("__route__")
        ...


If you have a decorator-based error handler that returns {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"}, you need dynamic routing so that the flow automatically transitions to “diagnose_errors” when an exception threshold is met.

Error Handling Decorator:

If you followed the previous advice to create an error_handler_decorator, make sure to do something like:

# If max_retries exceeded:
return {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"}


Then orchestrator.py or the compiled graph can handle that route.

Streamlit UI or Log:

If you want to show the user the “diagnostic_feedback” from the diagnose_errors node, you can do so in your Streamlit app. For instance, after the flow finishes, check if diagnostic_feedback exists in the final state or partial output.

Potential Circular Import Gotchas

If diagnostic_agent.py imports archon_graph.py, and archon_graph.py also imports something from diagnostic_agent.py, you get a circular import error.

Solution: A common approach is to have a separate states.py (holding only the typed state definitions) and a separate agents.py for the different agent objects. Then you can have:

archon_graph.py import from agents.py and states.py

diagnostic_agent.py import from agents.py (or define its own agent) and from states.py.

Keeping your typed data models in a single location helps avoid duplication or cyclical references.

Wrap-Up

By placing diagnostic_agent.py in its own file, you:

Keep the Diagnostic Agent logic clearly separate from your main sub-agents (reasoner, coder, etc.).

Avoid cluttering archon_graph.py or orchestrator.py with specialized error analysis code.

Make it straightforward to expand the diagnostic capabilities (e.g., more advanced prompts or retrieving logs from a DB).

Next Steps:

Double-check your file imports to avoid circular references.

Integrate diagnose_errors into your orchestrator.

Confirm your error-handling decorator or logic routes the flow to "diagnose_errors" when needed.

In your Streamlit UI (or other front-end), display the final state["diagnostic_feedback"] or ask the user if they want to apply the recommended fixes.

With this in place, your system can gather error logs, call the Diagnostic Agent, and provide reasoned suggestions or clarifications for the developer to fix issues—making Archon more resilient and self-aware!

show me the new updated complete code for archon_graph.py amd orchestrator.py and diagnostic_agent.py
ChatGPT said:
you'll have a **resilient** system that can autonomously handle errors and even diagnose issues when things go wrong. The diagnostic capability significantly improves the reliability of your workflow, enabling automatic error recovery and better feedback for users or developers. As mentioned, ensure that: 1. **Imports and Circular Imports**: You avoid duplication of type definitions and manage imports carefully, especially if they'll span multiple files (like `archon_graph.py`, `orchestrator.py`, and `diagnostic_agent.py`). 2. **Prerequisites**: Make sure `diagnostic_agent.py` is configured properly in terms of environmental variables and API keys. 3. **Testing**: Run your system with examples where deliberate failures are introduced to test the error recovery flow properly. From here, possible **next steps** include: - **Implementing a Self-healing mechanism**: This could involve having the `Diagnostic Agent` suggest code fixes or retries that can be tried automatically to resolve the issues. - **Expand diagnostics**: Fetch and analyze logs beyond just recent errors (e.g. querying external logs or historical failure patterns). - **Further tools enhancement**: Fine-tuning the connection between the `Diagnostic Agent` and Tool-based diagnostics, potentially feeding back into the system for automated fixes. Let me know what you'd like to proceed with, or if you need any refinement before moving to the next tasks! for 13 seconds

Below are three new/updated files showing how to integrate a Diagnostic Agent for error handling while keeping code modular and avoiding circular imports. The files include:

archon_graph.py – Defines your typed AgentState, core agents (Reasoner, Router, etc.), main node functions (define_scope_with_reasoner, coder_agent, etc.), and an error_handler_decorator to automatically log failures and re-route to diagnostic on repeated errors.

diagnostic_agent.py – Defines the specialized Diagnostic Agent and the diagnose_errors node function. It imports AgentState from archon_graph.py but does not import any nodes from archon_graph.py, avoiding circular references.

orchestrator.py – Builds the LangGraph with all nodes (including diagnose_errors), handles dynamic routing to the Diagnostic Agent, and runs the overall workflow.

Use these as drop-in or reference files. Adjust directory structure and imports as needed to match your existing codebase.

Key Points

We import diagnose_errors from diagnostic_agent.py and add it as a node.

We call builder.add_dynamic_route("__route__") so that if a node returns {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"}, the flow jumps to diagnose_errors.

After diagnosing, we lead to END in this example. (You could change that if you want the user to fix errors and continue.)

Summary of Integration

Holds the typed state, main sub-agents (Reasoner, Router, etc.), and the decorated node functions.

The decorator logs errors and returns {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"} if max_retries is exceeded.

diagnostic_agent.py:

Defines a separate Diagnostic Agent and a node function diagnose_errors that consults it.

Imports AgentState from archon_graph.py (one-way import, no circular reference).

orchestrator.py:

Builds the LangGraph flow with all node functions, including the new diagnose_errors.

Dynamically routes to "diagnose_errors" if the decorator returns {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"}.

Exposes start_flow(...) and resume_flow(...) for external UIs.

With these changes, your system now:

Logs errors in state["error_log"].

Retries node functions a configurable number of times.

Calls the Diagnostic Agent node on repeated failures to analyze logs.

Returns to END (or any other node, if you prefer a different flow).

Optional:

Show the user the “diagnostic_feedback” in your UI (e.g., Streamlit).

Store that feedback or the error logs in a Supabase table for historical analysis.

Let the user re-run or self-heal if the agent suggests code fixes.

That’s it! These three files should be sufficient to demonstrate a complete error-handling solution with a Diagnostic Agent in Archon V2. Adjust to taste, test thoroughly, and let me know if you have any questions!

Below is Task #4 from the earlier roadmap: Add a “Tool Generator” Sub-Agent. This agent will automatically scaffold new plugin code when the user (or the system) requests a new integration or capability. We’ll walk through:

High-Level Concept: What the Tool Generator Sub-Agent is supposed to do.

Plugin Template: How we’ll scaffold new .py plugin files.

Agent Definition: Creating a specialized “Tool Generator Agent.”

Node Function: A node in your LangGraph (or a method in the orchestrator) that calls this sub-agent.

Testing & Auto-Loading: Once created, how do we verify the new plugin works and dynamically load it?

Task #4: Add a “Tool Generator” Sub-Agent
1. High-Level Concept

Currently, you have a plugin architecture (Task #2) that looks for .py files in plugins/, each of which provides a class or function implementing your Tool interface. The “Tool Generator” Sub-Agent is meant to:

Receive a request for a new tool (for example, “Build me a Slack integration so we can post messages to Slack channels.”).

Look at any relevant API docs, user input, or your existing plugin examples.

Generate a new .py file in plugins/, containing the necessary code (e.g., credentials, endpoints, methods).

(Optional) Add tests or attempt a quick “smoke test” to confirm it loads properly in your system.

Register or reload the new plugin, making it immediately available for your orchestrator or coder agent.

2. Plugin Template

Below is a simple example of a plugin template for a hypothetical Slack tool:

PLUGIN_TEMPLATE = """\"\"\"
This plugin integrates with Slack to post messages to a channel.
Generated automatically by the Tool Generator Sub-Agent.
\"\"\"

import os
from typing import Any

class {class_name}:
    name = "{tool_name}"
    description = "{tool_description}"

    def run(self, message: str, channel: str) -> str:
        \"\"\"
        Post a message to Slack channel.
        Return confirmation or error.
        \"\"\"
        # Example:
        # token = os.getenv("SLACK_API_TOKEN")
        # if not token:
        #    return "Error: Missing Slack API token."

        # ... code that calls Slack API ...
        return f"Mock posting '{message}' to channel: {channel}"
"""


This PLUGIN_TEMPLATE is a Python string that includes placeholders ({class_name}, {tool_name}, {tool_description}) for the sub-agent to fill in. In a more sophisticated scenario, you’d generate additional code for authentication, error handling, docstrings, etc.

3. Agent Definition
a. “Tool Generator Agent” System Prompt

We can define a specialized agent that knows how to produce plugin code. It might use your existing “coding agent” approach (like pydantic_ai_coder) or it can be its own agent. For example:

# tool_generator_agent.py

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

load_dotenv()

BASE_URL = os.getenv('BASE_URL', 'https://api.openai.com/v1')
API_KEY = os.getenv('LLM_API_KEY', 'no-llm-api-key-provided')
TOOL_GEN_MODEL = os.getenv('TOOL_GEN_MODEL', 'gpt-4o-mini')

tool_generator_agent = Agent(
    OpenAIModel(TOOL_GEN_MODEL, base_url=BASE_URL, api_key=API_KEY),
    system_prompt="""
You are a Tool Generator Agent. Your job is to produce Python plugin files 
that fit our plugin architecture. 
When given a request like 'Build me a Slack plugin', you will:
1. Read any relevant API docs (if provided).
2. Generate a .py plugin in the correct format, with a class implementing:
   - name
   - description
   - run(...) method
3. Provide complete code in your final answer.

Follow these constraints:
- Use the provided PLUGIN_TEMPLATE as a base for your code if available.
- Insert placeholders as needed, or generate new methods for the plugin's run(...) if requested.
    """
)

b. Node Function

We define a node function that calls tool_generator_agent. The user’s request might be something like: “Create a plugin that posts messages to Slack.” The agent then returns the Python code for that plugin. Example:

# Still in tool_generator_agent.py or a new file

from archon_graph import AgentState
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage
# We'll pretend you have a PLUGIN_TEMPLATE stored in the same file or imported

PLUGIN_TEMPLATE = """\"\"\"
{tool_description}
\"\"\"

class {class_name}:
    name = "{tool_name}"
    description = "{tool_description}"

    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Insert logic here
        return "Example run output"
"""

async def generate_tool_code(state: AgentState):
    # We'll read the user's request from state['latest_user_message']
    user_req = state["latest_user_message"]
    # or you could do something more advanced with additional context

    prompt = f"""
User request: {user_req}

Using the plugin template, produce a new plugin named based on user request. 
"""

    result = await tool_generator_agent.run(prompt)
    # The agent's final answer should be the code for our new plugin
    return {"generated_code": result.data}


Note: In a more advanced approach, the sub-agent might do RAG calls to fetch API docs. For now, we keep it simple.

4. Writing the Plugin to Disk & Reloading

Once generate_tool_code returns the code, we want to:

Write it to a new .py file in plugins/.

Reload your plugin manager so the new plugin is recognized.

You can do that in your node function or in a subsequent step:

import os
from plugins.plugin_manager import load_plugins

async def finalize_new_tool(state: AgentState):
    """
    After generate_tool_code has run, we take 'generated_code' from the state,
    write it to a .py file, and reload the plugin registry.
    """
    code = state.get("generated_code", "")
    if not code.strip():
        return {"tool_creation_status": "No code generated."}

    # Example file naming logic
    # If user said "Build me a Slack plugin", we might parse the name from the prompt,
    # or just do a random timestamp-based name:
    file_name = "tool_generated.py"
    file_path = os.path.join("plugins", file_name)

    with open(file_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(code)

    # Reload plugins
    load_plugins("plugins")

    return {"tool_creation_status": f"Plugin created: {file_name}"}


Integration in the Flow: You have two new nodes: generate_tool_code and finalize_new_tool.

The user says, “I want a Slack plugin.”

Flow calls generate_tool_code → returns generated_code.

Flow calls finalize_new_tool → writes the code to disk, calls load_plugins(...).

Now the new plugin is available in your registry.

5. Orchestrator Updates

In orchestrator.py, add these nodes:

# orchestrator.py
from tool_generator_agent import generate_tool_code, finalize_new_tool
# from plugins.plugin_manager import load_plugins
...

def _build_graph(self):
    builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

    # existing nodes
    builder.add_node("define_scope_with_reasoner", define_scope_with_reasoner)
    builder.add_node("coder_agent", coder_agent)
    builder.add_node("get_next_user_message", self.get_next_user_message)
    builder.add_node("finish_conversation", finish_conversation)
    builder.add_node("diagnose_errors", diagnose_errors)

    # new tool gen nodes
    builder.add_node("generate_tool_code", generate_tool_code)
    builder.add_node("finalize_new_tool", finalize_new_tool)

    builder.add_dynamic_route("__route__")

    # add edges or conditional edges to route the user to generate_tool_code 
    # when they request a new integration, etc.

    # for example, if route_user_message detects "create_tool" in user_msg:
    # builder.add_conditional_edges(
    #   "get_next_user_message", route_user_message,
    #   { "coder_agent": "coder_agent",
    #     "finish_conversation": "finish_conversation",
    #     "create_tool": "generate_tool_code"
    #   }
    # )
    ...

    return builder.compile(checkpointer=self.memory)


You might do something like:

async def route_user_message(state: AgentState):
    user_msg = state["latest_user_message"].lower()
    if "finish" in user_msg:
        return "finish_conversation"
    elif "create tool" in user_msg or "new plugin" in user_msg:
        return "generate_tool_code"
    else:
        return "coder_agent"


Then:

“generate_tool_code” → the user’s next message might confirm or provide more details → we do get_next_user_message again → then “finalize_new_tool” → end or back to “coder_agent.”

6. Testing & Auto-Loading

Manual Test:

Remove any tool_generated.py from plugins/.

Run your orchestrator or Streamlit UI.

Send a user message: “Create a plugin that does X.”

Flow calls generate_tool_code → user can refine → calls finalize_new_tool.

Check plugins/ folder for the new file.

Confirm it shows up in your plugin manager: print(TOOLS_REGISTRY) after load_plugins(...).

Optional:

Run a “smoke test” by calling the newly created plugin’s run(...) method from a “tester node” or automatically after finalizing.

Putting It All Together

Once you have:

tool_generator_agent.py – The specialized agent that outputs plugin code.

generate_tool_code – Node function that calls the agent.

finalize_new_tool – Node function that writes the code to plugins/ and reloads.

Flow logic in orchestrator.py that knows when to jump to these nodes based on user input or system reasoning.

… you’ll have a system that can automatically create new .py plugin files, enabling new integrations or functionalities on the fly. Over time, you can expand your “Tool Generator” sub-agent with:

API Doc Parsing: If the user provides an API doc link, the sub-agent can do RAG queries to craft a plugin that hits specific endpoints.

Credential Handling: Prompt the user for credentials, store them in .env or a secure store.

Automated Testing: The sub-agent might generate a test script that gets run to ensure the plugin works.

This approach paves the way for truly dynamic expansions of your Archon-based system. Next, you might:

Integrate these steps into your error handling or Diagnostic Agent: If the system repeatedly fails due to a missing integration, it can propose building a new plugin.

Provide a Streamlit or n8n interface so the user can say “Add a plugin for X” with minimal friction.

That’s it for the Tool Generator Sub-Agent! If you have more questions or want advanced features (like code testing or doc-based generation), let me know. Otherwise, you’re onto the next steps—enhancing your UI, storing logs in the DB for advanced analytics, or scaling on Proxmox as your system grows.

Below are the new or changed files from the previous step for implementing the Tool Generator Sub-Agent. This includes:

A new file tool_generator_agent.py, containing:

The Tool Generator Agent definition.

Two node functions: generate_tool_code and finalize_new_tool.

A simple plugin template string.

Minor updates in orchestrator.py so it knows about these new node functions and can optionally route users to them.

An optional snippet you can add to archon_graph.py if you want to trigger tool creation via route_user_message.

I’ll also outline where in your project structure these changes typically go.

1. New File: tool_generator_agent.py

Place this in your iterations/v2-agentic-workflow/ folder (or wherever you keep your agent code). For consistency, you might create a new file called tool_generator_agent.py alongside archon_graph.py and diagnostic_agent.py.

# tool_generator_agent.py

Project Structure Placement

Assuming your structure looks like this:

v2-agentic-workflow/
├── archon_graph.py
├── orchestrator.py
├── diagnostic_agent.py
├── tool_generator_agent.py  (new file)
├── plugins/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── plugin_manager.py
│   ├── ...


tool_generator_agent.py can live in the same folder as archon_graph.py or diagnostic_agent.py.

2. Updates to orchestrator.py

In your orchestrator.py, import these new node functions (generate_tool_code and finalize_new_tool) and add them as nodes in your LangGraph flow.

# orchestrator.py

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.types import interrupt

# Existing imports
from archon_graph import (
    AgentState,
    define_scope_with_reasoner,

    route_user_message,
    finish_conversation
)
from diagnostic_agent import diagnose_errors

# NEW: import the tool generator node functions
from tool_generator_agent import generate_tool_code, finalize_new_tool

class Orchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = MemorySaver()
        self.graph = self._build_graph()

    def _build_graph(self):
        builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

        # Existing nodes
        builder.add_node("define_scope_with_reasoner", define_scope_with_reasoner)
        builder.add_node("coder_agent", coder_agent)
        builder.add_node("get_next_user_message", self.get_next_user_message)
        builder.add_node("finish_conversation", finish_conversation)
        builder.add_node("diagnose_errors", diagnose_errors)

        # NEW: tool generator nodes
        builder.add_node("generate_tool_code", generate_tool_code)
        builder.add_node("finalize_new_tool", finalize_new_tool)

        builder.add_dynamic_route("__route__")

        # Edges
        builder.add_edge(START, "define_scope_with_reasoner")
        builder.add_edge("define_scope_with_reasoner", "coder_agent")
        builder.add_edge("coder_agent", "get_next_user_message")

        builder.add_conditional_edges(
            "get_next_user_message",
            route_user_message,
            {
                "coder_agent": "coder_agent",
                "finish_conversation": "finish_conversation",
                # We'll add a new route for create_tool if desired:
                "create_tool": "generate_tool_code"
            }
        )

        builder.add_edge("finish_conversation", END)
        builder.add_edge("diagnose_errors", END)

        # Once we generate code, we probably want to finalize it, then end or go back to get_next_user_message
        builder.add_edge("generate_tool_code", "finalize_new_tool")
        builder.add_edge("finalize_new_tool", END)

        return builder.compile(checkpointer=self.memory)

    def get_next_user_message(self, state: AgentState):
        value = interrupt({})
        return {"latest_user_message": value}

    def start_flow(self, user_message: str):
        initial_state = {
            "latest_user_message": user_message,
            "messages": [],
            "scope": "",
            "error_log": [],
            "error_retries": {}
        }
        return self.graph.run(initial_state)

    def resume_flow(self, user_message: str):
        return self.graph.run(user_message)

Explanation of Changes

Imported generate_tool_code and finalize_new_tool from tool_generator_agent.py.

Added them as nodes in the flow with builder.add_node(...).

Set a conditional edge from "get_next_user_message" to "generate_tool_code" if route_user_message returns "create_tool". That means if the user says “create tool,” we jump to the code generator.

Linked generate_tool_code → finalize_new_tool → END. This is a simple linear path. You can route back to “get_next_user_message” if you want a second confirmation step.

3. Optional Snippet for archon_graph.py

If you want route_user_message to detect a user’s request for a new tool, add logic like this:

# archon_graph.py

@error_handler_decorator("route_user_message", max_retries=1)
async def route_user_message(state: AgentState):
    user_msg = state["latest_user_message"].lower()

    # If user says "finish", we end
    if "finish" in user_msg:
        return "finish_conversation"

    # If user says "create tool" or "new plugin", we route to generate_tool_code
    if "create tool" in user_msg or "new plugin" in user_msg:
        return "create_tool"

    # Default path
    return "coder_agent"


With this snippet, if a user types “create tool for Slack,” the node returns "create_tool", which your orchestrator.py flow interprets as "generate_tool_code", then it eventually calls "finalize_new_tool", ending the flow.

Where to Add These Instructions

tool_generator_agent.py (new file)

Location: In the same folder as archon_graph.py, diagnostic_agent.py, etc. (e.g. v2-agentic-workflow/).

Content: The entire code snippet shown above, with the PLUGIN_TEMPLATE, tool_generator_agent, and node functions generate_tool_code/finalize_new_tool.

orchestrator.py

Add the lines importing the new nodes:

from tool_generator_agent import generate_tool_code, finalize_new_tool


Add builder.add_node("generate_tool_code", generate_tool_code) and builder.add_node("finalize_new_tool", finalize_new_tool).

Connect them in your flow with edges.

archon_graph.py (optional snippet)

In your route_user_message node function, handle logic for "create_tool" or "new plugin" so that you can branch to the new tool generator flow.

plugins/

No direct changes unless you want to store your PLUGIN_TEMPLATE there. But the main point is that finalize_new_tool will write a new file (e.g. tool_generated.py) into plugins/ and call load_plugins("plugins").

Once you have these changes:

Run your system (via Streamlit or other UI).

Enter a user message like “create tool for Slack, so I can send channel notifications.”

The system should route to "generate_tool_code", the sub-agent produces code, then "finalize_new_tool" writes that code to plugins/tool_generated.py and reloads the plugin registry.

Check the plugins/ folder for the new .py file.

Final Summary

tool_generator_agent.py is entirely new, placed in your main code folder (alongside archon_graph.py).

orchestrator.py changes**: 2 new node registrations (generate_tool_code, finalize_new_tool), plus edges.

archon_graph.py changes** (optional)**: A line or two in route_user_message to detect “create tool” and return "create_tool".

This completes the integration for a Tool Generator Sub-Agent that can dynamically produce new plugin files. If you run into any issues or want to add more advanced code generation logic (like reading actual API docs), just let me know!

Below is a side-by-side comparison of your current orchestrator.py (which includes the diagnostic node logic) and the new suggestions for adding the Tool Generator nodes. I’ll then provide a unified version that merges the two, so you can see exactly which lines to add.

1. Your Current Orchestrator

Observations

It includes diagnose_errors logic and dynamic routing for __route__.

It has no references to any tool-generator nodes (like generate_tool_code or finalize_new_tool).

2. Additional Lines for Tool Generator Nodes

In the new approach, we recommended adding:

Imports from tool_generator_agent:

from tool_generator_agent import generate_tool_code, finalize_new_tool


Registering those as nodes:

builder.add_node("generate_tool_code", generate_tool_code)
builder.add_node("finalize_new_tool", finalize_new_tool)


Edges for the new nodes, e.g.:

builder.add_edge("generate_tool_code", "finalize_new_tool")
builder.add_edge("finalize_new_tool", END)


Optional: If your route_user_message can return "create_tool", then add to the conditional edges:

"create_tool": "generate_tool_code"


That’s essentially it for orchestrator changes. Everything else remains the same as your “old” orchestrator code.

3. Unified Orchestrator (Merged Version)

Lines to Notice:

Imports from tool_generator_agent:

from tool_generator_agent import generate_tool_code, finalize_new_tool


builder.add_node("generate_tool_code", generate_tool_code) and builder.add_node("finalize_new_tool", finalize_new_tool).

An extra route in builder.add_conditional_edges for "create_tool": "generate_tool_code" if your route_user_message returns "create_tool".

Edges from generate_tool_code → finalize_new_tool → END.

Everything else remains consistent with your older code. This ensures you retain all the existing features (diagnostic node, error handling, dynamic route for __route__), while adding the new tool generator sub-agent functionality.

Conclusion

Your existing orchestrator code is already set up for dynamic routing with error handling.

The only changes needed for tool generator integration are:

Imports for the new nodes.

Registering the new nodes in _build_graph.

Adding edges to define the path from “generate_tool_code” → “finalize_new_tool” → END (or wherever else you want it to go).

(Optionally) hooking up a new route in route_user_message so user can say “create tool” to jump there.

By merging these lines into your existing orchestrator file, you have a single, comprehensive orchestrator that includes diagnostic error handling and tool generator flows.

... the graph. - **Adding edges** to connect the flow and route to the tool generator when the user requests it. You should be able to merge these changes directly into your version of `orchestrator.py`. Once done, the system will be able to generate new tools on demand by interacting with the Tool Generator Sub-Agent while maintaining its error-handling and diagnostic capabilities. Let me know if you'd like further clarification on any aspect of merging these changes or how to test the new tool generation features! for 9 seconds

Below is a final merged archon_graph.py that incorporates:

Typed AgentState (including fields for error logging).

Sub-Agents (Reasoner, Router, End Conversation).

Error-Handling Decorator to route repeated failures to "diagnose_errors".

Node Functions for:

define_scope_with_reasoner

coder_agent

route_user_message (including an example snippet for returning "create_tool" if the user says “create tool” or “new plugin”)

finish_conversation

It does not define the diagnose_errors node directly here, since we’re treating that as part of diagnostic_agent.py. However, if you prefer to keep diagnose_errors in this file, you can simply copy/paste it and remove the import from diagnostic_agent.py.

You can post this file to your GitHub fork. Make sure your diagnostic_agent.py file also exists if you’re importing diagnose_errors from there, and that your orchestrator.py references this file’s node functions.

How This Works

Agents: We have reasoner, router_agent, and end_conversation_agent. Each uses a different system prompt.

Typed State: AgentState includes error_log and error_retries for automatic error tracking.

error_handler_decorator: If a node fails max_retries times, it returns {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"}, which your Orchestrator needs to handle by adding a dynamic route (and the diagnose_errors node from diagnostic_agent.py).

Node Functions:

define_scope_with_reasoner: Gathers a scope.

coder_agent: The main coding logic.

route_user_message: Decides whether to keep coding, finish, or create a new tool. (We added the "create_tool" return path for the Tool Generator flow.)

finish_conversation: Ends the flow with a farewell message.

Remember: If you keep diagnose_errors in a separate file (diagnostic_agent.py), the orchestrator can reference it from there. If you want diagnose_errors in the same file, copy/paste that function and remove the external import.

Usage / Next Steps

In orchestrator.py, ensure you do:

builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "get_next_user_message",
    route_user_message,
    {
        "coder_agent": "coder_agent",
        "finish_conversation": "finish_conversation",
        "create_tool": "generate_tool_code"  # your new tool generator node
    }
)


Then the user’s phrase “create tool” triggers a jump to "generate_tool_code", which lives in tool_generator_agent.py.

If any node fails too many times, {"__route__": "diagnose_errors"} is returned, and your orchestrator should route to the diagnose_errors node from diagnostic_agent.py.

That’s it! You can push this archon_graph.py to GitHub, and you’ll have a final, consolidated version that:

Handles errors gracefully.

Supports reasoner, router, and finishing logic.

Provides a path for the user to request new tools (“create tool”).

You said:
what else is needed
ChatGPT said:
Reasoned for 4 seconds

Below is a brief checklist of what else you may need or want to do, now that your archon_graph.py, orchestrator.py, diagnostic_agent.py, and tool_generator_agent.py are in place. These suggestions reflect the remaining roadmap items and the typical integrations you’d do next.

1. Verify Your Plugin Architecture

Ensure you have a plugins/ folder with:

__init__.py (empty file, marking it as a Python package).

plugin_manager.py (or a similar file) that includes:

A base Tool(Protocol) or equivalent interface.

A TOOLS_REGISTRY.

A load_plugins("plugins") function that scans .py files and registers them.

Confirm that newly generated plugins (e.g., tool_generated.py) appear in the plugins/ folder and get picked up by load_plugins("plugins").

If you haven’t set up a plugin manager yet, you’ll need that to actually see the new tool code in action.

2. Integrate the New Flow in Your UI (e.g., Streamlit)

In streamlit_ui.py (or wherever you handle user input/output):

Initialize the Orchestrator.

start_flow(...) on the first user message, resume_flow(...) on subsequent ones.

Make sure that if the user says something like “Create tool for Slack,” you allow the conversation to proceed to the “tool generator” nodes.

Display any final messages from the system (like diagnostic feedback or a summary after generating a plugin).

Optional: Show the user “diagnostic_feedback” from the diagnose_errors node, or “tool_creation_status” from the finalize_new_tool node, so they know what happened.

3. Handle Creds & Testing for New Plugins

When the Tool Generator Sub-Agent creates a new plugin, you may need to:

Prompt the user to provide API keys or credentials.

Store them in .env or in a secrets manager.

Optionally run a basic test or “smoke test” node to confirm the plugin works (by calling tool.run() in the new file).

In a production environment, you’d want to verify the generated plugin can actually talk to the external API (Slack, Twilio, etc.) rather than just creating stub code.

4. Advanced Error-Handling & Self-Healing

Right now, your Diagnostic Agent logs an error and suggests fixes. You might want to:

Store error logs in a DB table (e.g. a Supabase table) for historical analysis.

Integrate the Diagnostic Agent with the Tool Generator or your “Coder Agent” to automatically attempt code fixes.

Allow the user to confirm the suggested fix before it’s applied.

5. Database & Logging Improvements

If you want more advanced analytics:

Add a table in Supabase (or another DB) for “agent_runs,” storing each conversation or each node’s output.

Dashboard these logs in Grafana or another tool to spot patterns, repeated failures, etc.

Let the Diagnostic Agent query these logs to see if a similar error was solved before.

6. Integrations with n8n or Node-RED

If you want a low-code or no-code UI for chaining tasks:

Build a custom n8n node that calls your Orchestrator’s start / resume endpoints.

Visually combine the Archon workflow with other automations (e.g., hooking up triggers from Slack, CRMs, etc.).

7. Deployment & Scaling

Containerize your orchestrator, DB, and any local LLMs if you’re using them, then orchestrate them on your Proxmox cluster.

If you have heavy load or large models, you can scale up or spin up more containers.

8. Optional: Additional Multi-Agent Patterns

If you have more specialized tasks, you can:

Add more sub-agents (e.g., “UI Builder Agent,” “Documentation Summarizer Agent”).

Let them talk to each other or pass partial results back to your “Master Orchestrator.”

Wrap-Up

In summary, you now have the core building blocks:

archon_graph.py – Node definitions, typed state, error-handling decorator.

orchestrator.py – Constructs and runs the LangGraph flow.

diagnostic_agent.py – Handles repeated errors.

tool_generator_agent.py – Dynamically creates new plugins.

To make the system production-ready, you’ll likely want to:

Refine your UI integration (Streamlit / n8n).

Add real credential usage and testing for newly generated plugins.

Improve logging, analytics, and potential self-correction steps.

Nothing else is strictly required to get you up and running—but the above tasks will help you reach a truly robust and user-friendly solution. If you have more specific needs or questions, just let me know!

Let me know if you'd like to further refine any part of this or get assistance with deployment. for 4 seconds

Below is Task #5 from the original roadmap—Enhancing the UI (for example, via Streamlit) or Integrating with a low-code workflow tool (like n8n). We’ll cover some practical steps and considerations for each approach.

Task #5: Enhancing the UI or Integrating with n8n
1. Streamlit UI Enhancements

You already have a streamlit_ui.py that likely references the Orchestrator to start and resume flows. Let’s outline some ways you can improve it now that you have multiple nodes (Diagnostic, Tool Generator, etc.):

Structured Output Display

Right now, you may be streaming text chunks from the Orchestrator’s partial outputs. You can enhance this by detecting if the last node run is diagnose_errors or finalize_new_tool, then show a special message or panel in Streamlit.

For example, if the final node returns a {"diagnostic_feedback": ...}, present it in a red “Error Diagnostics” box, or if you get {"tool_creation_status": ...}, show a success message, maybe even reload the page so the new plugin is recognized.

Tabs or Sidebar

Use Streamlit’s st.sidebar or multi-page app support to create separate pages / sections:

Main Chat: The conversation with the main Orchestrator flow.

Logs / Debug: A real-time view of state["error_log"], or any historical runs.

Plugins: A page listing available plugins from your plugins/ folder, with a button to “Reload Plugins.”

Forms or Additional Input Fields

If you anticipate the user providing more detailed specs for the Tool Generator, you can add st.text_area(...) or st.text_input(...) fields for them to fill out, then pass that data to the Orchestrator.

Example: “Enter your Slack Webhook URL” or “Enter an API Key,” which your sub-agent can store in .env or somewhere secure.

Logging & Debugging

Use st.write() or st.json() calls to show the user a structured summary of the final AgentState or partial states after each node. This helps debugging any weird transitions.

Example: Conditional Display for Diagnostic Feedback
# snippet for streamlit_ui.py

if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# ... after you run orchestrator.resume_flow(...)
final_state = orchestrator.graph.state  # or however you capture final state
diagnostic_feedback = final_state.get("diagnostic_feedback")
if diagnostic_feedback:
    st.error(f"Diagnostics: {diagnostic_feedback}")

tool_creation_status = final_state.get("tool_creation_status")
if tool_creation_status:
    st.success(tool_creation_status)

2. n8n Integration
a. Why n8n?

n8n
 is a low-code automation tool that lets you create workflows visually. You can:

Create a custom “Archon Node” that sends a user’s message (and context) to your Orchestrator’s endpoint, waits for a response, and then passes it along the flow.

Trigger the orchestrator on external events (e.g., “When I get a new Slack mention, pass it to Archon.”).

b. Architecture

Run your Archon system behind an API endpoint. For instance, you could create a small FastAPI or Flask server with two endpoints:

POST /start_flow – For the first user message; calls orchestrator.start_flow(...).

POST /resume_flow – For subsequent messages; calls orchestrator.resume_flow(...).

In n8n:

Create an HTTP Request Node or a custom node that calls your Archon endpoints.

Chain it with other nodes (Slack, Gmail, Trello, etc.) so that data can flow in or out of your Orchestrator.

c. Step-by-Step

Create a small archon_server.py with something like:

from fastapi import FastAPI
from orchestrator import Orchestrator

app = FastAPI()
orchestrator = Orchestrator()

@app.post("/start_flow")
def start_flow(payload: dict):
    user_message = payload.get("user_message", "")
    result = orchestrator.start_flow(user_message)
    # return partial or final text
    return {"result": result, "state": orchestrator.graph.state}

@app.post("/resume_flow")
def resume_flow(payload: dict):
    user_message = payload.get("user_message", "")
    result = orchestrator.resume_flow(user_message)
    return {"result": result, "state": orchestrator.graph.state}


Run it: uvicorn archon_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080.

In n8n:

Create an HTTP Request node that sends a JSON body like {"user_message":"Hello, I'd like to create a Slack tool"} to http://<server>:8080/start_flow.

Capture the response, parse out the result or state, and let n8n pass that to the next step.

For subsequent interactions, call /resume_flow with the user’s next input.

If you want interactive, chat-like usage inside n8n, you can keep calling /resume_flow until your orchestrator’s flow ends. Alternatively, you can do partial streaming, but that’s more advanced.

3. “Hands-Free” Workflow Execution

With an n8n integration, you can do things like:

Automatically create a plugin if a certain condition is met. For instance, if n8n sees an error message from a Slack node that indicates you don’t have Slack integrated, it might call your “Tool Generator Sub-Agent” with a request for a Slack plugin.

Schedule tasks, so Archon runs at certain intervals or triggers from events (like a new lead in a CRM).

4. Combining Streamlit & n8n

It’s possible to have both:

Streamlit for an interactive, user-friendly chat approach.

n8n for automation tasks.

They can share the same Orchestrator instance if you code an internal queue or the same API endpoints, but you need to consider concurrency and state management (i.e., ensuring that the conversation state for each user or process is tracked properly).

Tip: One approach is to use session IDs or user tokens to maintain separate states in your Orchestrator’s memory (like MemorySaver). That way, multiple concurrent flows don’t overwrite each other.

5. Potential UI Next Steps

Dynamic Node Visualization: In Streamlit, you could display your StateGraph as a diagram, showing the active node. Tools like graphviz or pyvis can help.

Detailed Node Logging: Print out each node’s input and output in a table or collapsible panel.

Advanced n8n Node: Build a custom node for n8n that includes a user-friendly GUI for hooking up your Archon flow, controlling which sub-agent is used, and so on.

Wrap-Up

Task #5 essentially addresses:

Streamlit UI improvements: making the user experience friendlier, showing structured logs, prompting for credentials, or debugging each node’s output.

n8n Integration: allowing a purely drag-and-drop approach to hooking your Archon orchestrator into broader automation pipelines.

Your next steps depend on what kind of user experience and automation you want. Typically:

If you want a user-facing chat: Focus on Streamlit.

If you want to integrate with many external services: Focus on n8n.

If you want both: Build them in parallel, ensuring your orchestrator can handle multiple sessions and track states individually.

Once you have the UI sorted out, you can move on to tasks like DB & Logging improvements (Task #6) or deployment & scaling (Task #7) to handle bigger workloads or more advanced error logging. Let me know if you’d like more details on those topics!

what files for the project changed in step 5 above - show me the full code of all new files and any changed files
ChatGPT said:

Below is a unified view of new and changed files mentioned in Task #5 (UI or n8n integration). Specifically:

archon_server.py (new file) – An example FastAPI server exposing /start_flow and /resume_flow endpoints for the Orchestrator.

streamlit_ui.py (example changes) – Updated to display special feedback from nodes like the Diagnostic Agent or Tool Generator.

No changes to archon_graph.py, orchestrator.py, diagnostic_agent.py, tool_generator_agent.py are strictly required at this step, unless you want to handle concurrency or session IDs. We'll show you how you might optionally handle them if you want multiple concurrent sessions.

Use these as references for your project. Adjust them to your folder layout (e.g., if you keep archon_server.py in the project root or inside v2-agentic-workflow/).

1. archon_server.py (New File)

A minimal FastAPI server that wraps the Orchestrator in two endpoints: /start_flow and /resume_flow. This is how you’d integrate with n8n (or any other external system) that wants to drive your Archon flows via HTTP calls.

# archon_server.py

import os
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from orchestrator import Orchestrator

# If you want concurrency and multiple user sessions, you might keep a dict of orchestrator instances
# For now, we'll do a single global Orchestrator for simplicity
orchestrator = Orchestrator()

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/start_flow")
async def start_flow(request: Request):
    """
    Initializes a brand-new flow using the Orchestrator.
    Payload might look like: {"user_message": "Hello, I'd like to do X"}
    """
    data = await request.json()
    user_message = data.get("user_message", "")

    # Optionally parse a session_id if you want multiple concurrent sessions
    # session_id = data.get("session_id", "default")

    result = orchestrator.start_flow(user_message)
    # We'll return the entire result plus the final state
    # The 'result' can be partial text or a generator if you want streaming
    state = orchestrator.graph.state  # The final or current state
    return {"result": result, "state": state}

@app.post("/resume_flow")
async def resume_flow(request: Request):
    """
    Resumes an existing flow after an interruption (waiting for user input).
    Payload might look like: {"user_message": "Ok, let's do it"}
    """
    data = await request.json()
    user_message = data.get("user_message", "")

    # session_id = data.get("session_id", "default")

    result = orchestrator.resume_flow(user_message)
    state = orchestrator.graph.state
    return {"result": result, "state": state}

Where to Place This File

Typically at your project root or inside v2-agentic-workflow/.

If you run uvicorn archon_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080, n8n can do HTTP calls to http://<host>:8080/start_flow or /resume_flow.

2. streamlit_ui.py (Changes)

Below is a complete example of streamlit_ui.py that:

Displays normal chat messages.

Shows special feedback from the diagnostic_agent or the tool_generator_agent (like diagnostic_feedback or tool_creation_status).

Uses orchestrator.start_flow() or orchestrator.resume_flow().

# streamlit_ui.py

import streamlit as st
import asyncio
from orchestrator import Orchestrator

# If you have logs or DB, import them here
# from supabase import Client
# from .env or something

st.set_page_config(page_title="Archon - Agent Builder", layout="wide")

# Initialize Orchestrator
orchestrator = Orchestrator()

@st.cache_resource
def get_thread_id():
    # If you want separate session IDs for each user or conversation
    import uuid
    return str(uuid.uuid4())

thread_id = get_thread_id()

async def run_flow_stream(user_input: str):
    """
    Runs the orchestrator in "streaming" mode, if you have that set up.
    If not, you can just call .start_flow(...) or .resume_flow(...) and yield the final text.
    """
    # If first user message, start_flow
    if len(st.session_state.messages) == 1:
        # This might not be streaming if your orchestrator doesn't yield
        # We'll simulate partial chunks anyway
        results = orchestrator.start_flow(user_input)
        yield str(results)
    else:
        results = orchestrator.resume_flow(user_input)
        yield str(results)

def main():
    st.title("Archon - Agent Builder")

    if "messages" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.messages = []

    # Show existing conversation
    for msg in st.session_state.messages:
        with st.chat_message(msg["type"]):
            st.markdown(msg["content"])

    user_input = st.chat_input("Describe your AI agent or request a new plugin...")
    if user_input:
        # Add to session
        st.session_state.messages.append({"type": "user", "content": user_input})
        with st.chat_message("user"):
            st.markdown(user_input)

        response_content = ""
        with st.chat_message("assistant"):
            message_placeholder = st.empty()
            async def handle_flow():
                async for chunk in run_flow_stream(user_input):
                    nonlocal response_content
                    response_content += chunk
                    message_placeholder.markdown(response_content)
            asyncio.run(handle_flow())

        st.session_state.messages.append({"type": "assistant", "content": response_content})

        # After the flow, we can check the final orchestrator state for special fields
        final_state = orchestrator.graph.state  # Or however you store the final state
        # E.g., if the Diagnostic Agent was triggered
        if "diagnostic_feedback" in final_state:
            st.error("Diagnostics:\n" + final_state["diagnostic_feedback"])
        # If the Tool Generator ran
        if "tool_creation_status" in final_state:
            st.success(final_state["tool_creation_status"])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

Key Changes

After the user message finishes, we check final_state = orchestrator.graph.state for:

diagnostic_feedback (from your diagnostic_agent.diagnose_errors node).

tool_creation_status (from your tool_generator_agent.finalize_new_tool node).

We display them in Streamlit as st.error(...) or st.success(...).

Note: If your orchestrator is truly streaming partial chunks, you might have to adapt the code to yield partial LLM output. Otherwise, you can just do a single call to start_flow / resume_flow and display the final text.

3. Optional Concurrency / Session IDs

If you want multiple users or multiple flows simultaneously:

Add a session_id param to your orchestrator calls.

Store a dictionary of session_id → Orchestrator instance or store a dictionary of states in your MemorySaver.

In the archon_server.py, parse the incoming session_id and pick the correct orchestrator or state.

Example:

# archon_server.py
orchestrators = {}

@app.post("/start_flow")
async def start_flow(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    user_message = data.get("user_message", "")
    session_id = data.get("session_id", "default")

    if session_id not in orchestrators:
        orchestrators[session_id] = Orchestrator()

    result = orchestrators[session_id].start_flow(user_message)
    state = orchestrators[session_id].graph.state
    return {"result": result, "state": state}


Similarly for /resume_flow.

But if you’re just running a single Flow for demonstration or internal usage, you can keep one global orchestrator instance.

4. Summary of New / Changed Files
New Files

archon_server.py – Minimal FastAPI for n8n or external calls.

Updated Files

streamlit_ui.py – Example changes to show structured feedback from the final Orchestrator state.

No Required Changes to:

archon_graph.py (unless you want concurrency changes in the typed state).

orchestrator.py, diagnostic_agent.py, tool_generator_agent.py remain the same from previous steps.

Wrap-Up

Now you have two major ways to interface with Archon:

Streamlit – A friendly chat UI that can show diagnostic or tool-creation messages.

n8n or other tools – Using the FastAPI server with endpoints that let you programmatically drive the flow.

You can push these new or changed files to your GitHub fork if you wish to preserve them. If you run into any conflicts or have a different file structure, just adapt the import paths accordingly.

With that, you’ve covered Task #5: UI enhancements (Streamlit) and n8n integration via an HTTP server. Next steps might include advanced concurrency or robust logging to a database (Task #6), or finalizing your Proxmox deployment strategy (Task #7)!

You said:
since my branding is Zippy for anything I build or run - how can I incorporte my branding into my fork of this Archon witout being invasive to the original developer?
ChatGPT said:
database, but you can always enhance the system further based on specific needs! for 6 seconds

Below are some suggestions on how to incorporate your Zippy branding into your Archon fork without removing credit or overshadowing the original developer. The overarching principle is to preserve the original author’s attributions and license, while clearly indicating that this fork is branded and maintained by you as “Zippy.”

1. Keep the Original License & Attribution

First and foremost, if Archon is licensed under an open-source license (like MIT), you must keep the license file intact in your fork and preserve existing attribution notices:

Retain the original author’s name, links, and copyright statements.

Do not remove the license header from source files or disclaimers in the README about the original author, unless the license explicitly allows it (and even then, it’s best practice to keep it).

This ensures you remain compliant and respectful to the original author.

2. Update Fork Name & README to Reflect “Zippy”
a. GitHub Repository Name

When you create (or rename) your fork, you can call it something like Zippy-Archon or zippy-archon.

In the project description, add a line like:

“A fork of Cole Medin’s Archon, extended and maintained by Zippy.”

b. README File

At the top of your README, add a section like:

# Zippy's Archon (Fork of Cole Medin’s Archon)

This is a customized fork of [Archon by Cole Medin](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon). 
It includes additional branding and features maintained by Zippy. 


Link back to the original repository, clarifying you’re building upon it.

Retain or merge original content from the upstream README so you don’t lose the original instructions or disclaimers. Then add your “Zippy” branding—such as a logo, color scheme, or custom tagline.

3. Adjust References in the User-Facing Strings
a. System Prompts & UI Strings

Wherever your code uses phrases like “Archon” in prompts or logs, you can rename them to reflect your brand, for instance:

“Zippy’s Archon” or “Zippy AI Orchestrator” if you want a combined brand name.

In Streamlit UI or n8n messages: “Welcome to Zippy's Archon Agent Builder!”

Example:

# streamlit_ui.py
st.title("Zippy's Archon - Agent Builder")
...

b. Console / Log Messages

If you print or log lines that say “Archon is starting,” you can change them to say “Zippy’s Archon is starting.” This is user-facing but doesn’t remove references to the original code internally.

4. Theming & Logo

If you have a logo or color palette:

In Streamlit:

Use st.set_page_config(page_title="Zippy's Archon", page_icon="path/to/zippy_logo.png").

Consider injecting a small custom CSS or images to brand the top or sidebar.

If you build a FastAPI or other web endpoints:

Provide a swagger UI with your Zippy branding (e.g., a custom doc page title or favicon).

For n8n integration:

If you create a custom node, name it “Zippy Archon Node” or “Zippy Orchestrator Node,” with your brand visible in the node’s summary.

5. Non-Invasive Code Changes

As you incorporate branding:

Do not remove or rename function/class references purely for brand reasons if it might cause confusion or break existing references. For instance, if classes or modules are named archon_graph, that’s fine to keep them as is under the hood.

A typical approach is to rename top-level user-facing modules or executables (like the repo name, main UI text) while leaving the internal structure.

For example:

zippy-archon/
├── archon_graph.py   # you keep the name
├── orchestrator.py
├── ZIPPY_README.md   # new file or updated README
...


Because it’s less intrusive to keep the internal references but apply your brand at the entry points.

6. Credit the Original Developer Prominently

Open source etiquette calls for giving explicit credit to the project’s original author in your documentation:

Fork Notice – “This is a fork of Archon by Cole Medin. All credits for the original concept and code go to them.”

License – Keep the original license text and author lines.

Acknowledgment – If you add new features, highlight them as “Zippy additions” or “Zippy custom features,” but keep the original references to show you’re building upon someone else’s foundation.

7. Potential Example

Here’s how your README might look:

# Zippy's Archon (Fork of Archon by Cole Medin)

Zippy's Archon is a customized version of [Cole Medin's Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) project, 
featuring additional branding, a refined plugin architecture, 
and various enhancements for enterprise deployments.

## Original Project & License

The original Archon code is licensed under the MIT license (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)), 
and all credits go to Cole Medin. 
We have retained all references and license terms from the original repository. 
Any new features added by Zippy are also provided under the same open-source license.

## What's New in Zippy's Archon

- [Zippy Branding] UI enhancements, custom logos, theming
- [Feature A] Self-Healing Orchestrator with advanced error handling
- [Feature B] Tool Generator Sub-Agent for plugin creation

## Getting Started

Follow the original instructions from Archon below, or see [Zippy Setup](#zippy-setup) for extra steps...

...


In your setup instructions, rename references to “archon” for user-facing commands, if that makes sense, but keep the developer references to the original code structure intact.

Conclusion

By renaming user-facing references (e.g., repo name, UI text, main README heading) to “Zippy’s Archon,” while keeping the original license, attributions, and file-level references, you:

Respect the original developer’s rights and authorship.

Clearly present your brand to end users in a non-invasive way.

Maintain good open source etiquette and compliance.

This approach ensures you can highlight Zippy as your brand while continuing to credit the original author, fostering a positive relationship and adhering to open-source best practices. If you ever want to upstream changes, the original developer can see exactly what you changed, and you remain respectful of their original naming and licensing.

implement concurrency and session IDs - show me all completed files with full path
ChatGPT said:
Reasoned for 6 seconds

Below is a fully updated version of the Archon-based project that supports concurrency and session IDs—allowing multiple independent conversations or user sessions at once. We’ll show six files with full paths (assuming your fork is named zippy-archon), each containing the relevant code:

zippy-archon/archon_graph.py

zippy-archon/diagnostic_agent.py

zippy-archon/tool_generator_agent.py

zippy-archon/orchestrator.py (unchanged aside from removing any single-instance references)

zippy-archon/archon_server.py (new concurrency-based HTTP server)

zippy-archon/streamlit_ui.py (updated to handle session IDs)

The main difference from earlier code is that archon_server.py keeps a dictionary of session_id → Orchestrator instances, and streamlit_ui.py tracks a session_id in st.session_state. This ensures each user or each separate session has its own orchestrator state, preventing cross-talk.

Usage

Run: uvicorn archon_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

n8n or any other client can do:

POST /start_flow
{
  "session_id": "user123",
  "user_message": "Hello"
}

POST /resume_flow
{
  "session_id": "user123",
  "user_message": "Create tool for Slack"
}


Each session_id gets its own Orchestrator instance, so they won’t clash.

6. zippy-archon/streamlit_ui.py (Updated for Concurrency)

Below is an example that uses st.session_state["session_id"] to keep track of a unique session in your archon_server dictionary.

# zippy-archon/streamlit_ui.py

import streamlit as st
import requests
import uuid

API_URL_START = "http://localhost:8080/start_flow"
API_URL_RESUME = "http://localhost:8080/resume_flow"

# We'll store a session_id in st.session_state to keep concurrency separate
def init_session():
    if "session_id" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    if "messages" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.messages = []

init_session()

st.title("Zippy's Archon - Streamlit UI with Concurrency")

def display_messages():
    for msg in st.session_state.messages:
        with st.chat_message(msg["type"]):
            st.markdown(msg["content"])

display_messages()

user_input = st.chat_input("Ask Archon, or type 'create tool' to build a plugin...")
if user_input:
    st.session_state.messages.append({"type": "user", "content": user_input})
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(user_input)

    # Decide if this is the first message or a resume
    if len(st.session_state.messages) == 1:
        # first message -> start_flow
        payload = {
            "session_id": st.session_state.session_id,
            "user_message": user_input
        }
        resp = requests.post(API_URL_START, json=payload).json()
    else:
        # subsequent -> resume_flow
        payload = {
            "session_id": st.session_state.session_id,
            "user_message": user_input
        }
        resp = requests.post(API_URL_RESUME, json=payload).json()

    # Show result
    final_text = resp.get("result", "")
    final_state = resp.get("state", {})
    st.session_state.messages.append({"type": "assistant", "content": final_text})

    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        st.markdown(final_text)

    # Check if there's special data like diagnostic_feedback or tool_creation_status
    diagnostic_feedback = final_state.get("diagnostic_feedback")
    if diagnostic_feedback:
        st.error("Diagnostic Feedback:\n" + diagnostic_feedback)

    tool_creation_status = final_state.get("tool_creation_status")
    if tool_creation_status:
        st.success(tool_creation_status)


Explanation

session_id: We store a UUID in st.session_state.session_id so each user in Streamlit has a unique conversation.

On the first user message, we call /start_flow. For subsequent ones, /resume_flow.

We store all user and assistant messages in st.session_state.messages for the chat UI.

We display any additional info from final_state, like diagnostic_feedback or tool_creation_status.

Putting It All Together

With these six files:

archon_graph.py – Node definitions, typed state, error decorator.

diagnostic_agent.py – Node function for diagnosing repeated errors.

tool_generator_agent.py – Node functions for generating a new plugin and finalizing it.

orchestrator.py – Builds the LangGraph flow and offers start_flow / resume_flow.

archon_server.py – New concurrency-based server that maps session_id → Orchestrator.

streamlit_ui.py – Example concurrency usage with a unique session_id per Streamlit user.

You now have:

Multiple user sessions in parallel (n8n or direct HTTP calls).

A streamlit UI that also uses concurrency by storing a session_id.

Tool generation & Diagnostic features in the same orchestrator flow.

If you run into any path or import issues, adjust them accordingly (e.g., referencing files in the same directory or subdirectories). Otherwise, you can push these to your fork under the zippy-archon/ folder for a fully functional concurrency-enabled Archon-based system.

That’s all needed for concurrency + session IDs!

It looks like I’ve provided some comprehensive guidance on how to update and enhance your Archon-based system with concurrency and session IDs. Is there something specific you'd like to dive deeper into, or is this shaping up well for your project needs now? Let me know if you'd like further clarification or additional steps to implement! for 7 seconds

Below is a short checklist of what else you’ll typically want to include, beyond those six files, to make your zippy-archon/ folder functional and self-contained. Much of this depends on which parts of Archon’s original code and environment you rely on, but here are the common elements:

1. plugins/ Folder & plugin_manager.py

If you plan to leverage the Tool Generator Sub-Agent, you need a plugins/ folder and the “plugin manager” code that scans and loads .py plugin files. Typically:

zippy-archon/
└── plugins/
    ├── __init__.py  (empty file marking it as a package)
    ├── plugin_manager.py
    └── ...


In plugin_manager.py, you’d have something like:

# plugin_manager.py
import os
import importlib
import inspect
from typing import Protocol, Dict

class Tool(Protocol):
    name: str
    description: str
    def run(self, *args, **kwargs) -> str:
        ...

TOOLS_REGISTRY: Dict[str, Tool] = {}

def register_tool(tool: Tool):
    if tool.name in TOOLS_REGISTRY:
        raise ValueError(f"Tool '{tool.name}' is already registered.")
    TOOLS_REGISTRY[tool.name] = tool

def load_plugins(plugins_dir: str):
    """
    Dynamically import .py files in 'plugins_dir' 
    and register any classes or objects that meet the 'Tool' interface.
    """
    for filename in os.listdir(plugins_dir):
        if not filename.endswith(".py"):
            continue
        if filename in ["__init__.py", "plugin_manager.py"]:
            continue
        module_name = filename[:-3]
        module = importlib.import_module(f"plugins.{module_name}")
        for name, obj in inspect.getmembers(module):
            if hasattr(obj, "name") and hasattr(obj, "run"):
                register_tool(obj if not inspect.isclass(obj) else obj())


This way, your tool_generator_agent.py can call load_plugins("plugins") after writing a new plugin file, making it available immediately.

2. .env File (or .env.example)

You’ll likely want a .env (or .env.example) so you can store environment variables. For instance:

BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
DIAGNOSTIC_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
TOOL_GEN_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
# etc...


Remember:

If your original code used Supabase or other external services, you’ll want those env variables as well (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, etc.).

Each user or environment can copy .env.example to .env and fill in their keys.

3. requirements.txt (Project Dependencies)

To ensure anyone installing your fork can replicate your Python environment, include or update a requirements.txt that has the necessary packages:

fastapi==0.103.0
uvicorn==0.23.2
streamlit==1.25.0
pydantic_ai==0.0.22
langgraph==0.2.69
# ...plus any other packages you rely on (requests, etc.)


If you’re not pinned to specific versions, you can just list top-level packages. Or you can keep a more pinned approach for reproducibility.

4. __init__.py Markers

If you want Python to treat each folder (like zippy-archon/, plugins/, etc.) as a proper package or module, it helps to include an __init__.py file in those directories—sometimes empty. For example:

zippy-archon/
    __init__.py
    archon_graph.py
    orchestrator.py
    ...
    plugins/
        __init__.py
        plugin_manager.py


This step ensures import statements like from plugins.plugin_manager import load_plugins work smoothly.

5. README & LICENSE

README – If you’re distributing a customized Archon, you’ll want a README.md that explains:

How to run archon_server.py (uvicorn archon_server:app --port 8080)

How to run streamlit_ui.py (streamlit run streamlit_ui.py)

Steps to set up .env, etc.

License – If the original Archon was MIT (or another license), keep that license in your repo. Mention your branding as “Zippy’s Archon is a fork of [Archon by Cole Medin] under MIT,” etc.

6. (Optional) Anything Else from Original Iterations

If you want the doc-crawling features or RAG retrieval from Supabase (like crawl_pydantic_ai_docs.py or site_pages.sql), you’d need to carry those over as well. For example:

crawl_pydantic_ai_docs.py – If you still want to do doc ingestion into Supabase.

site_pages.sql – If you need the table creation scripts for your doc chunks.

But if you’re focusing on the concurrency approach and the core agentic flow, you can leave these out unless you specifically want the documentation-crawling features.

Summary

plugins/ folder + plugin_manager.py – Needed to fully support the “Tool Generator” approach.

.env or .env.example – Let you store environment variables (API keys, base URLs, etc.).

requirements.txt – Helps with easy environment setup.

__init__.py in relevant directories for clean imports.

README & LICENSE – Provide usage instructions, disclaimers, licensing details.

Optional: Original doc crawling scripts, Supabase integration, or other advanced features from earlier iterations.

With these in place, your zippy-archon iteration folder will be a standalone, concurrency-enabled Archon-based system that’s easy for others to install, run, and extend.

ChatGPT said:
This concludes our list of key files and enhancements necessary to make your **`Zippy-Archon`** fork fully functional. Here's a summary of the last suggestions: 1. **`plugins/` folder** to support **Tool Generator** features, with the corresponding **`plugin_manager.py`**. 2. A **`.env` file** (or `.env.example`) for environment variables like API keys. 3. A **`requirements.txt`** file to ensure collaborators can install the same dependency versions. 4. **`__init__.py`** files in key project directories to enable package-style imports. 5. Ensure your **`README.md`** clearly outlines setup instructions and gives credit to the original author, maintaining open-source compliance. 6. (Optional) Include previous features like document crawling or Supabase integrations if needed. By ensuring these components are included, you'll have not only a fully functional **Zippy-Archon** project but also a few extra enhancements for wider usability! If you'd like to further customize the project, add advanced features, or detail deeper integrations with other platforms/tools, feel free to let me know! for 8 seconds

Below is a complete directory tree and the full contents of each file recommended for your zippy-archon/ folder. This setup provides a self-contained, concurrency-capable Archon fork, with a plugin system, a diagnostic agent, a tool generator agent, and a Streamlit + FastAPI interface.

You can copy and paste each file’s contents exactly into your project. Adjust any references (e.g. hostnames, ports, environment variables) as needed.

# Zippy's Archon

This is a fork of Cole Medin's Archon, branded and maintained by **Zippy**.

It supports:
- **Multi-agent workflow** with Pydantic AI and LangGraph
- **Diagnostic Agent** for error handling
- **Tool Generator Sub-Agent** for plugin creation
- **Concurrency** via session IDs (multiple orchestrators in memory)
- **Streamlit** UI for chat
- **FastAPI** endpoints for external integrations (n8n, etc.)

## Setup

1. **Clone** this repository.
2. **Install** dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd zippy-archon
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt


Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your API keys and model preferences.

Running the System

FastAPI server for concurrency and external calls:

uvicorn archon_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080


This exposes /start_flow and /resume_flow.

Streamlit UI for local chat:

streamlit run streamlit_ui.py

Using the Plugins

The system writes newly generated plugins to plugins/.

The plugin_manager.py automatically loads them on load_plugins("plugins").

Final Notes

Adjust Imports if your actual folder structure or naming differs.

Run the environment with:

cd zippy-archon
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn archon_server:app --port 8080
# And in another terminal: 
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py


n8n or Other Tools can call POST /start_flow and POST /resume_flow with JSON {"session_id":"something","user_message":"..."}

Generated Plugins appear in zippy-archon/plugins/, auto-loaded by plugin_manager.py.

With these files in place, you have a complete concurrency-enabled Archon fork under the Zippy brand, featuring diagnostic error handling, a plugin system, a tool generator sub-agent, and a user-friendly Streamlit chat UI.

what else do we need to add to this - what other files and integrations can we complete now
ChatGPT said:
Reasoned for 4 seconds

Below is a follow-up list of additional files and integrations you might want to add to your newly created Zippy-Archon setup, beyond the six core files plus plugin system. Each of these ideas can enhance functionality, reliability, or ease of use, depending on your objectives.

1. Database Integration & Advanced Logging
a. Store Conversation Logs & Agent Runs in a DB

Motivation: Having all user messages, node outputs, and errors in a database lets you analyze usage patterns, debug issues, or build advanced analytics.

Implementation:

Introduce a DB client (e.g., Postgres, Supabase, MongoDB).

Each time you call start_flow or resume_flow, store an entry in a table like agent_runs with columns for session_id, user_message, node transitions, error logs, etc.

Optionally, store final states or partial states so you can do post-run analysis.

New File Suggestions:

A small file, e.g., db_logging.py, that exports functions like log_run(session_id, node_name, user_input, agent_output, error_log, etc.).

Then you call those logging functions at key points in your orchestrator or archon_server routes.

b. Advanced Error Logging

You may want to log the “diagnostic_feedback” from diagnostic_agent.py to see how often it’s triggered, or how effective it is.

Combine with a time-series DB or a logging aggregator (e.g., Grafana, Splunk) if you want real-time dashboards.

2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Doc Crawling

If you want your agents to reference large sets of documentation or content (like the original Archon did with Pydantic AI docs), you can add:

crawl_pydantic_ai_docs.py (or a more general crawler):

Crawls or ingests docs, stores them in a vector store.

Vector DB (Supabase, Pinecone, Qdrant, or local solutions) to store embeddings.

RAG Node – A node function that, given a user query, does an embedding lookup and returns relevant doc chunks to the agent.

New Files:

crawl_docs.py – your custom crawler that splits text into chunks, generates embeddings, and upserts into the vector DB.

rag_tool.py – a plugin or node that runs vector similarity queries and returns relevant info to the agent.

With that, your system can answer doc-based questions or build new agents referencing doc chunks.

3. Containerization & Orchestration
a. Docker / Docker Compose

Why: Package the entire system (FastAPI server, Streamlit UI, DB, etc.) for easy deployment.

How:

Create a Dockerfile in the zippy-archon/ folder that installs Python, copies code, and runs uvicorn archon_server:app.

Optionally, create a docker-compose.yml that spins up the container(s) plus a Postgres or Supabase container for your doc store or logs.

New Files:

Dockerfile

docker-compose.yml

Possibly a .dockerignore to limit what goes into the container.

b. Proxmox or Kubernetes

If you have a Proxmox cluster or want more advanced scaling, you can create images/VMs or define a Helm chart for Kubernetes. This is more advanced but ensures you can scale horizontally.

4. Automated Testing & CI/CD
a. Test Harness

Add a tests/ folder with Pytest or unittest scripts that:

Spawn your Orchestrator, run a “happy path” flow, assert final outputs are as expected.

Force error states to check the Diagnostic Agent is triggered properly.

Generate a tool and confirm it’s actually loaded by plugin_manager.py.

New Files:

tests/test_orchestrator.py

tests/test_plugins.py

etc.

b. GitHub Actions / CI

If you want to run tests automatically on GitHub:

A .github/workflows/ci.yml that installs dependencies, runs pytest, etc.

Possibly build and push a Docker image if it’s part of your release process.

5. Credential Management & Secret Storage

If your user flows involve connecting to external APIs (e.g., Slack, Twilio), you might want a standard approach to storing or retrieving credentials:

Encrypted .env or secret manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).

A small credentials module that your plugin tools can import, ensuring credentials are never stored in the plugin code.

6. n8n Node (Custom Integration)

While you can already call your archon_server.py routes from n8n’s HTTP Request node, you can also build a “Zippy Archon” custom node in n8n:

Create a new node module: n8n-nodes-zippy-archon.

Implement the standard methods (execute() in JavaScript/TypeScript) to:

Collect the user’s text input

Send it to start_flow or resume_flow on your server

Return the agent’s response as node output

This would let n8n users drag & drop a “Zippy Archon” node directly into workflows. They’d configure the server URL, session_id, etc., and the node would handle the rest.

7. Advanced Self-Healing / Code-Fixing Agent

Currently, the Diagnostic Agent just returns suggestions. You can take it a step further:

Have the Diagnostic Agent or another “Auto-Fixer Agent” propose actual code changes in the Archon or plugin files.

Potentially route them to your “Coder Agent” to apply those changes automatically, then reload. This is quite advanced but can be a powerful “continuous improvement” loop.

8. Multi-Tenant or Multi-Organization Support

If you want to serve multiple organizations or user groups from a single instance:

Extend your concurrency approach with org-level scoping:

org_id + session_id → Orchestrator instance or a shared DB reference

Each org might have its own environment variables or plugin sets.

Permission or RBAC in your plugin manager, so certain plugins only load for certain orgs.

Putting It All Together

Below is a consolidated list of potential expansions:

DB & Logging

db_logging.py or a similar file for storing conversation logs, node outputs, or error details in Postgres / Supabase.

Possibly a analytics.py or “dashboard” node for analyzing usage.

Doc Crawling / RAG

If you want question-answering on large docs, add crawl_docs.py and a vector DB integration.

A “DocRetrieval Node” that uses embeddings to retrieve relevant content for your main agent.

Containerization

Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, or a K8s Helm chart for easy deployment on your Proxmox cluster or other environments.

Testing & CI

tests/ directory with Pytest scripts to ensure each node and agent behaves correctly.

GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

Credential Management

Possibly a .env approach or hooking up to a secrets manager for storing API keys.

So user-provided credentials can be securely injected at runtime.

n8n Custom Node

Provide a user-friendly UI in n8n for hooking up Archon calls.

Reuse the concurrency approach by specifying session_id in the node config.

Self-Healing Code-Fixer

Let the Diagnostic Agent propose code patches.

Integrate them automatically into the code, run pytest, and re-load if successful.

Multi-Tenant

Expand your concurrency dictionary to store multiple organizations’ config.

Possibly store org-level plugin sets or memory states.

With these enhancements, your Zippy-Archon can evolve into a fully dynamic, multi-tenant, doc-savvy, self-healing orchestrator—covering just about every advanced use case for an AI-driven workflow engine. If you decide on specific expansions, feel free to ask for more detailed code examples!

# Discussion: Introducing Zippy-Archon – Our Fork of Archon with New Features & Roadmap

Hello everyone,

I’m excited to share **Zippy-Archon**, a custom fork and extension of the original [Archon project](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) by Cole Medin. In this discussion, I want to outline:

1. **What we’ve done so far** in terms of rebranding and extending the functionality.  
2. **Our roadmap** for future enhancements.  

## 1. What’s New in Zippy-Archon

- **Concurrency & Session IDs**  
  We now support multiple concurrent user sessions (via unique `session_id`s). Each session manages its own state and orchestrator instance, so you can have independent conversations/workflows.

- **Plugin Architecture**  
  Tools and integrations can be added or removed without modifying core files. Simply drop a `.py` file into the `plugins/` folder, and the system auto-detects and registers it.

- **Tool Generator Sub-Agent**  
  An AI-driven node that, given a user request (e.g., “Create a Slack plugin”), automatically generates the corresponding plugin file, saves it to the `plugins/` folder, and reloads the plugin manager.

- **Diagnostic Agent**  
  A specialized node that handles repeated failures. If a node fails multiple times, the flow routes to the Diagnostic Agent, which analyzes the error logs and proposes potential fixes or clarifications.

- **Streamlit UI & FastAPI Endpoints**  
  We’ve included a Streamlit-based interface for interactive chat, plus a FastAPI server (`archon_server.py`) that exposes `/start_flow` and `/resume_flow` endpoints. This lets you integrate with external tools or low-code platforms like n8n while maintaining concurrency.

- **Zippy Branding & README**  
  The fork retains original licensing and attributions, but is maintained under the “Zippy” brand. We’ve reorganized the code into a self-contained `zippy-archon/` folder for easy setup and extension.

## 2. Roadmap & Future Features

Below are key features and improvements we plan to work on. Feedback and pull requests are welcome!

1. **Database Integration & Logging**  
   - Store user messages, node outputs, and errors in a database (Postgres, Supabase, etc.).  
   - Possibly build a real-time dashboard or advanced analytics to track usage and error trends.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   - Add doc crawling scripts and a vector DB integration to let the AI reference large documentation sets.  
   - Provide a node or plugin that does embedding lookups and returns relevant chunks to the agent.

3. **Containerization & Deployment**  
   - Dockerfiles and/or Helm charts for easy deployment on Docker, Proxmox, or Kubernetes.  
   - Possibly a `docker-compose.yml` that spins up the orchestrator, a database, and a web UI in one go.

4. **Automated Testing & CI/CD**  
   - Pytest-based test harness for core flows (happy path, error handling, tool generation).  
   - Continuous integration with GitHub Actions to ensure stability on every commit.

5. **Credential Management**  
   - Systematic approach to storing and retrieving API keys or tokens, possibly hooking into secrets managers.  
   - Let newly generated plugins rely on environment variables or a secure store instead of hard-coded secrets.

6. **n8n Custom Node**  
   - A dedicated “Zippy-Archon” node for n8n, enabling drag-and-drop usage.  
   - Users could configure the session ID, orchestrator endpoint, and input prompts directly in n8n.

7. **Advanced Self-Healing**  
   - Let the Diagnostic Agent propose actual code patches in case of repeated failures.  
   - Potentially integrate with the tool generator or coder agent to apply fixes automatically.

8. **Multi-Tenant Support**  
   - If we want multiple organizations or teams to share a single instance, each org can have its own plugin set, memory, or error logs.  
   - Additional role-based access control to limit which tools or flows each user can access.

## Contributing & Feedback

If you have ideas, improvements, or bug reports:

- **Open an Issue** or start a new Discussion here.  
- **Submit PRs** — especially for new plugin integrations, improved doc crawling, or deployment scripts.  
- Let me know if you have suggestions for making the concurrency logic or plugin architecture even more robust.

I appreciate all the support and collaboration. Let’s continue extending this AI agent framework together!

Thanks,

I'm going to write a post on discord server called Forward Future AI owned by Matthew Berman, a well known youtuber in the AI space - about this new project - here is a draft - "I was watching this guy and his updated Archon project for automating Ai Agents - yes I know there is some weird beef between CrewAI and LangChain people for some reason - but I think we can all get along... anyow I cloned the repo and added some new features. Tell me what you think. " make it better - perhaps reference the original youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6LbW2IFUQw and my new github repo and his original repo https://github.com/ZippyNetworks/Zippy-Archon/discussions  and https://github.com/coleam00/Archon

Here's a polished version of your Discord post that keeps it engaging, informative, and inviting for discussion:

🚀 Exploring Archon AI Agent Automation – Plus My New Fork!

I was checking out this video
 about the Archon project by Cole Medin, which automates AI agents using LangGraph and Pydantic AI. I know there’s been some back-and-forth between CrewAI and LangChain folks, but honestly, we’re all just trying to push AI agent development forward, right? 😆

Anyway, I decided to clone the repo and extend it with new features, including:
✅ Concurrency support (multiple sessions via session IDs)
✅ Plugin-based tool system (drop-in .py files for new integrations)
✅ Automated tool generation (AI builds new plugins on demand)
✅ Diagnostic agent (error-handling AI that analyzes failures)
✅ Streamlit UI + FastAPI API for interactive workflows

If you’re into AI agent orchestration, check it out:
